abstract = {Smart systems have become key solutions for many application areas including autonomous farming. The trend we can see now in the smart systems is that they shift from single isolated autonomic and self-adaptive components to larger ecosystems of heavily cooperating components. This increases the reliability and often the cost-effectiveness of the system by replacing one big costly device with a number of smaller and cheaper ones. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of synergistic collaboration among autonomic components in the domain of smart farming---in particular, the use-case we employ in the demonstration stems from the AFar-Cloud EU project. We exploit the concept of autonomic component ensembles to describe situation-dependent collaboration groups (so called ensembles). The paper shows how the autonomic component ensembles can easily capture complex collaboration rules and how they can include both controllable autonomic components (i.e. drones) and non-controllable environment agents (flocks of birds in our case). As part of the demonstration, we provide an open-source implementation that covers both the specification of the autonomic components and ensembles of the use case, and the discrete event simulation and real-time visualization of the use case. We believe this is useful not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of architectures of collaborative autonomic components for dealing with real-life tasks, but also to build further experiments in the domain.},

abstract = {Background: The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm involves a network of devices that exchange data through the Internet. Defining IoT systems’ requirements addresses their functionality, device interactions, and data integration while meeting stakeholder needs. Design Thinking (DT) may support this process with its user-centered techniques. However, further empirical validation is needed to ensure their effectiveness in IoT software development. Aims: We aim to investigate two DT techniques, IoThinking and Mind IoT, in supporting the requirement elicitation phase for IoT systems, thus improving the development of better IoT systems. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment with 59 software engineering students to assess the effectiveness of both IoThinking and Mind IoT techniques in supporting the requirements elicitation phase for IoT systems. We measured the effectiveness based on the number of requirements each method helped derive. We also conducted a Focus Group with 15 participants to verify their perceptions of the techniques. Results: We found no statistical difference in the number of requirements derived by the two techniques, suggesting that both are equally effective. However, participants’ feedback suggested IoThinking is recommended during the requirements elicitation phase and appropriate for smaller, simpler projects. Mind IoT has its use recommended after an initial elicitation, helping on refine and map out established requirements. Conclusions: Our findings can guide software engineers in choosing the appropriate technique based on their IoT projects’ specific needs and scope.},

abstract = {The reusability of modular, embeddable components is a key determinant for the success of modern programming languages to ensure efficient and high-quality development. However, there is a gap in the field of domain-specific modeling regarding reusable components at the model level. While libraries are relatively common and a de facto standard for prominent programming languages, establishing model libraries is still in its infancy. This paper specifies building a model-driven component library that utilizes a self-extension mechanism. We demonstrate an approach to structure, build, and integrate such a library using a wide range of GUI components, from essential atomic elements and more complex composed components to specifically tailored ones for particular application domains. Employing such libraries at the model level further supports the goal of model-driven engineering to assist domain experts in efficiently building high-quality systems.},

The increasing reliance on computing workflows and digital data transactions requires ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or misuse. This research paper presents a comparative analysis of three novel approaches for authenticating and securing access to scientific data: SciTokens, Verifiable Credentials, and Smart Contracts. The aim of this study is to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach from trust, revocation, privacy, and security perspectives. We examine the technical features and privacy and security mechanisms of each technology and provide a comparative synthesis with the proposed model.

abstract = {The continuous spreading of the Internet-of-Things across application domains, aided by the continuous growth on the number of devices and systems that are Internet-connected, created both a rise in the complexity of these systems and made noticeable a lack of human resources with the expertise to design, develop and maintain them. Recent works try to mitigate these issues by creating solutions that abstract the complexity of the systems, such as using visual programming languages. Node-RED, as one of the most common solutions for the visual development IoT systems, stills has several limitations, such as the lack of observability and inadequate debugging mechanisms. In this work, we address some of these limitations by enhancing Node-RED with new features that improve the user's system development, debugging, and understanding tasks. We proceed to empirically evaluate the impact of these enhancements, concluding that, overall, such enhancements reduce the development time and the number of failed attempts to deploy the system.},

However, the complex characteristics of plants, and their relations to other plant species in terms of needs and capacities, require a complex knowledge base not easily acquired by novice gardeners. We contribute a demonstration of our project, called the Software for Agricultural Ecosystems (SAGE) Community Coordinator, that helps manage the complexities of plant relationships and provides planting suggestions based on existing plants in adjacent garden sites. The research team collected the requirements and developed a preliminary demonstration of this system. This demonstration shows the feasibility of the idea and lays the foundation for a more comprehensive implementation of the SAGE Community Coordinator. By doing so, this paper explores the use of technology to foster the establishment of complex plant assemblages in urban and suburban areas to address the current and future limits of material resources derived from plants.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 initiative envisions the flexible and optimized production of customized products on Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) that consist of subsystems coordinated to conduct complex production processes. Hence, accurate CPPS modeling requires integrating the modeling of variability for Product-Process-Resource (PPR) aspects. Yet, current variability modeling approaches treat structural and behavioral variability separately, leading to inaccurate CPPS production models that impede CPPS engineering and optimization. This paper proposes a PhD project for integrated variability modeling of PPR aspects to improve the accuracy of production models with variability for CPPS engineers and production optimizers. The research project follows the Design Science approach aiming for the iterative design and evaluation of (a) a framework to categorize currently incomplete and scattered models and methods for PPR variability modeling as a foundation for an integrated model; and (b) a modeling approach for more accurate integrated PPR variability modeling. The planned research will provide the Software Product Line (SPL) and CPPS engineering research communities with (a) novel models, methods, and insights on integrated PPR variability modeling, (b) open data from CPPS engineering use cases for common modeling, and (c) empirical data from field studies for shared analysis and evaluation.},

Today, such smart communities are highly heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and services only to their local community inhabitants. ComDeX uses property graphs to represent smart community entities and automatically maps them to context-aware publish/subscribe messages. Such messages can be discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated topology and an advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using well-known IoT technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic smart port scenario and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT scenarios with synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments where the number of hops between brokers of the federation increases.},

IoT is a new paradigm in which intelligent objects equipped with sensors, networks, and processing technologies integrate and work together to provide smart services to users. In the face of the rapid growth in the number of connected devices in an IoT scenario, the perspective of a smarter world could be actual. However, it is still too far away due to challenges related to human interaction. To help understand the issues involved in building experiences with multiple devices, we conducted interviews with ten companies exploring the characteristics and challenges surrounding the IoT project to designing IoT technologies. The results identified a set of qualitative data from companies that are developing IoT projects allowing us to discuss future directions for research. Our main contribution is related to the identification of important aspects of IoT that impact the design of user-friendly solutions. We conclude pointing to the need for IoT design that takes into account the users' particularities.},

abstract = {Early Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) implementations were focused on data entry and report generation within a farm. The growth in areas such as Precision Agriculture (PA) is changing the landscape and approach taken to develop such systems. The lack of standardised data formats to support the transfer of data between systems is one of the major concerns that have been raised relating to the development of FMIS. The modern FMIS based on the distributed systems which inherently supports the sharing of resources and data. Service-oriented architectures are more flexible in relation to the delivery of software packages; for example, cloud computing can be utilized to offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to agriculturalists. In general, these systems are monolithic, which is built as a single unit of software. These monolithic systems have several challenges, especially scalability, rebuild, retesting and deployment issues. The modern microservice approach can be recognised as the solution for these issues. Microservice approach is organised a distributed application as a collection of services, where each service design, implement and run independently. The basic microservice concept is based on virtual machines and the Application Program Interface (API). The next level of container based microservice systems has less runtime overhead compared to virtual machine basic microsevices. This technology is also more efficient as many containers can be run in a single virtual machine. The container based system also comes with key features and tooling around to addressing microservice challenges. The researchers conclude the paper by recommending a container based microservice architecture for agile FMIS in precision agriculture.},

abstract = {As the availability of computing infrastructure continues to increase, so too does the need for accessible means for utilizing those resources. An effective approach is to enable desktop-oriented scientific software tools and frameworks to support execution on high performance cyberinfrastructure in a way that is transparent to the user. We have found this to be the case in our ongoing environmental modeling study in which we are applying multidisciplinary, integrated models to the study of a depleting aquifer. Our models are linked together using the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) which provides a composition framework for the sequential execution of model components. In this work we investigate the potential for incorporating parallelism into the OpenMI as a first-class citizen. We present a general solution in which model components may be executed in parallel without requiring changes to their source code. An alternate solution achieves greater parallelism through simultaneous invocations of individual components, but requires them to be modified in some cases. These can result in significant reductions in simulation runtimes on both multi-core desktop machines as well as in high performance computing environments. We demonstrate this potential speedup in a performance study in which the application of the general solution achieved 86% of linear speedup when executed on a high performance machine with 80 cores.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are collections of autonomous devices with computational, sensing and wireless communication capabilities. Research in this area has been growing in the past few years given the wide range of applications that can benefit from such a technology.In this paper, the development of a highly modular and miniaturized wireless platform for sensor networks is described. The system incorporates a radio transceiver (in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band) with embedded protocol software to minimize power consumption and maximize data throughput. Additional input capability for sensor and actuator integration can be incorporated seamlessly due to the modular nature of the system. The total system is packaged in a modular 25mm cubed form factor. A smaller, (10mm cubed), prototype is currently under development. Ongoing development of highly miniaturized nodes is discussed},
