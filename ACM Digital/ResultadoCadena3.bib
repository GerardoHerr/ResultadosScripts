abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) offers promising opportunities to address global sustainability challenges such as climate change and social inequality by enabling energy savings and social innovations. At the same time, ICT threatens to exacerbate these crises, as evident in the increasing consumption of resources and widening digital inequalities. As one of the enablers of ICT, software engineering plays a key role to tackle the problems and explore the potentials of ICT for sustainability. However, sustainability in software engineering is still a niche topic, with little structure, a limited understanding of sustainability and few comprehensive strategies. In this article, we introduce the main concepts of Sustainable Software Engineering, critically review the state of research and identify seven future research challenges across all research areas. We further present our research vision—sustainability-driven software engineering and transdisciplinary research formats—and outline a research roadmap with the key steps to be achieved by 2030.},

abstract = {Empathy, defined as the ability to understand and share others’ perspectives and emotions, is essential in software engineering (SE), where developers often collaborate with diverse stakeholders. It is also considered as a vital competency in many professional fields such as medicine, healthcare, nursing, animal science, education, marketing, and project management. Despite its importance, empathy remains under-researched in SE. To further explore this, we conducted a socio-technical grounded theory (STGT) study through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 software developers and stakeholders. Our study explored the role of empathy in SE and how SE activities and processes can be improved by considering empathy. Through applying the systematic steps of STGT data analysis and theory development, we developed a theory that explains the role of empathy in SE. Our theory details the contexts in which empathy arises, the conditions that shape it, the causes and consequences of its presence and absence. We also identified contingencies for enhancing empathy or overcoming barriers to its expression. Our findings provide practical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.},

abstract = {Smart systems have become key solutions for many application areas including autonomous farming. The trend we can see now in the smart systems is that they shift from single isolated autonomic and self-adaptive components to larger ecosystems of heavily cooperating components. This increases the reliability and often the cost-effectiveness of the system by replacing one big costly device with a number of smaller and cheaper ones. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of synergistic collaboration among autonomic components in the domain of smart farming---in particular, the use-case we employ in the demonstration stems from the AFar-Cloud EU project. We exploit the concept of autonomic component ensembles to describe situation-dependent collaboration groups (so called ensembles). The paper shows how the autonomic component ensembles can easily capture complex collaboration rules and how they can include both controllable autonomic components (i.e. drones) and non-controllable environment agents (flocks of birds in our case). As part of the demonstration, we provide an open-source implementation that covers both the specification of the autonomic components and ensembles of the use case, and the discrete event simulation and real-time visualization of the use case. We believe this is useful not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of architectures of collaborative autonomic components for dealing with real-life tasks, but also to build further experiments in the domain.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a rise in recognition of the need for computing education to bridge the gap between academia and industry. In addition, educational researchers are also interested in increasing student engagement by grounding learning experiences in real-life concerns, community issues, or personal interests. Unfortunately, traditional lecture-based teaching techniques often fail to prepare students for the challenges they will face in real-world software development scenarios. Project-Based Learning (PjBL) takes a different approach by immersing students in real-world software engineering projects, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical contexts, building practical skills, fostering critical thinking, and improving problem-solving abilities. Prior literature reviews have explored aspects of PjBL in computing education, such as communication support, educational effectiveness, sprint organization, and capstone course design. However, no literature review extensively and comprehensively examines the following questions as a whole: where PjBL is used, how it is taught, why it should be used, and what challenges to expect in software-related computing courses. The review takes a systematic approach, incorporating a thorough search strategy across four academic databases and targeting keywords associated with PjBL and software computing in higher education. A total of 34 PjBL course attributes were extracted from 184 selected primary studies, which contributed to answering six research questions: (1) What computing courses use PjBL? (2) What is the nature of software projects used? (3) How are these projects organized? (4) How are students assessed and evaluated? (5) What are the reported impacts of PjBL? and (6) How are students supported throughout the projects? The literature review makes four key contributions: a description of the nature of software projects used and how these projects are organized, a highlight of the impacts of PjBL and the methods used to measure those impacts, a summary of the various forms of support provided to students throughout their projects, and the list of challenges encountered in implementing PjBL and recommendations to alleviate those challenges. This comprehensive review offers new insights and serves as a catalog of best practices for computing educators.},

Unfortunately, many non-experimental studies suffer from potential endogeneity, for example, through omitted confounding variables, which precludes claims of causality. In this conceptual tutorial, we aim to transfer the proven solution of instrumental variables and two-stage models as a means to account for endogeneity from econometrics to the field of empirical software engineering. To this end, we discuss causality and causal inference, provide a definition of endogeneity, explain its causes, and lay out the conceptual idea behind instrumental variable approaches and two-stage models. We also provide an extensive illustration with simulated data and a brief illustration with real data to demonstrate the approach, offering Stata and R code to allow researchers to replicate our analyses and apply the techniques to their own research projects. We close with concrete recommendations and a guide for researchers on how to deal with endogeneity.},

abstract = {Software testing is a fundamental activity of the broader software engineering process. Internet of Things (IoT) testing activities present unique characteristics that make their execution different from conventional software testing, including specific challenges, tools, approaches, and processes. Although the literature contains several secondary studies that summarize the contributions on this topic, there still needs to be more organization of these studies along a software development process. This paper reports preliminary literature results showing how the knowledge about software testing has been applied to developing and using IoT systems. We conducted an initial search on known papers’ databases in computing and supplemented this search by snowballing two literature reviews found in this previous search. This study’s main results show that most approaches and tools for software testing on IoT systems are grouped in the stages of Validation by Emulation or Simulation with approximately 43% of the total of papers, followed by Validation by Testbed with approximately 24%. Hence, there is an opportunity for exploring further the Development and Operation/Support stages. Our results will help researchers and practitioners know when and in what sequence to use techniques, processes, and test tools reported in the literature.},

A carbon-aware scheduler, S.C.A.L.E (Scheduler for Carbon-Aware Load Execution), was developed and applied to a resource-intensive data processing pipeline at ING. The scheduler optimizes the use of green energy hours, times with higher renewable energy availability, and lower carbon emissions. The S.C.A.L.E comprises three modules for predicting task running times, forecasting renewable energy generation and electricity grid demand, and interacting with the processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows an expected reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of around 20% when using the carbon-aware scheduler. The scheduler’s effectiveness varies depending on the season and the expected arrival time of the batched input data. Despite its limitations, the scheduler demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of implementing a carbon-aware scheduler in resource-intensive processing pipeline.},

abstract = {Robotic systems are becoming an integral part of human lives.   Responding to the increased demands for robot productions, Robot   Operating System (ROS), an open-source middleware suite for robotic   development, is gaining traction by providing practical tools and   libraries for quickly developing robots. In this paper, we are   concerned with a relatively less-tested class of bugs in ROS and   ROS-based robotic systems, called semantic correctness bugs, including   the violation of specification, violation of physical laws, and   cyber-physical discrepancy. These bugs often stem from the   cyber-physical nature of robotic systems, in which noisy hardware   components are intertwined with software components, and thus cannot be   detected by existing fuzzing approaches that mostly focus on finding   memory-safety bugs.    We propose RoboFuzz, a feedback-driven fuzzing framework that integrates   with ROS and enables testing of the correctness bugs. RoboFuzz features   (1) data type-aware mutation for effectively stressing data-driven ROS   systems, (2) hybrid execution for acquiring robotic states from both   real-world and a simulator, capturing unforeseen cyber-physical   discrepancies, (3) an oracle handler that identifies correctness bugs by   checking the execution states against predefined correctness oracles,   and (4) a semantic feedback engine for providing augmented guidance to   the input mutator, complementing classic code coverage-based feedback,   which is less effective for distributed, data-driven robots. By   encoding the correctness invariants of ROS and four ROS-compatible   robotic systems into specialized oracles, RoboFuzz detected 30   previously unknown bugs, of which 25 are acknowledged and six have   been fixed.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging computation platform known for their safety-critical need. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a widely used open-source UAV software framework, Paparazzi, with the goal of understanding the safety-critical concerns of UAV software from a bottom-up developer-in-the-field perspective. We set our focus on the use of Bounding Functions (BFs), the runtime checks injected by Paparazzi developers on the range of variables. Through an in-depth analysis on BFs in the Paparazzi autopilot software, we found a large number of them (109 instances) are used to bound safety-critical variables essential to the cyber-physical nature of the UAV, such as its thrust, its speed, and its sensor values. The novel contributions of this study are two fold. First, we take a static approach to classify all BF instances, presenting a novel datatype-based 5-category taxonomy with finegrained insight on the role of BFs in ensuring the safety of UAV systems. Second, we dynamically evaluate the impact of the BF uses through a differential approach, establishing the UAV behavioral difference with and without BFs. The two-pronged static and dynamic approach together illuminates a rarely studied design space of safety-critical UAV software systems.},

abstract = {Components of IoT setups are subject to hardware failures, independently of software quality. These errors can be addressed by introducing hardware-level fault tolerance. This requires additional hardware components and the orchestration of tasks between them.    Erlang and Elixir, when running on BEAM, solve this problem for server-grade computers. However, IoT systems can also contain many microcontrollers that are too limited in resources to host BEAM.    AtomVM is a novel runtime for languages that traditionally run on BEAM. It brings many features of the runtime to embedded devices, including those necessary to monitor the failure of remote nodes and build fault-tolerant systems. As memory and computational power on microcontrollers are scarce, gauging how these features perform is essential.   In this study, we measure the cost of fault tolerance on ESP32-based AtomVM systems by comparing a single-node implementation of a particular setup with that of a fault-tolerant one. This test system handles the reception and processing of radio messages, a typical task for the embedded components of an IoT deployment.    Our measurements should help developers design applications that, while building on Erlang's fault tolerance, fit the limited resources available on microcontrollers.},

The university intends to utilize the forest for education purposes and as part of its community service plan. The yield of the forest is Green Beans, which is one of the finest coffee bean variants from Indonesia. Meanwhile, as El-Nino and La-Nina phenomena greatly affect the global climate nowadays, the changes also bring impacts to the yield of coffee beans. Responding to this situation, UB Forest procures a tool to measure climate indicators, such as air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture. However, this tool does not have an integrated monitoring system (a standalone system). Consequently, the forest conservators have to inspect the forest in person to conduct climate monitoring, requiring them to go through mountainous terrains. By taking advantage of the rapidly developing technology, this research aimed to create a website-based microclimate monitoring system that can remotely control the sensors in coffee fields. Utilizing RESTful API, the system sends data through sensors and presents them in a website built with Laravel and ReactJS. The system was subjected to testing with 100% unit test results and a value of 80 for usability testing.},

abstract = {The Web of Things (WoT) is a concept that aims to create a network of intelligent devices capable of remote monitoring, service provisioning, and control. Virtual and Physical Internet of Things (IoT) gateways facilitate communication, processing, and storage among social nodes that form the social Web of Things (SWoT). Peripheral IoT services commonly use device data. However, due to the limited bandwidth and processing power of edge devices in the IoT, they must dynamically alter the quality of service provided to their connected clients to meet each user's needs while also meeting the service quality requirements of other devices that may access the same data. Consequently, deciding which transactions get access to which Internet of Things data is a scheduling problem.Edge-cloud computing requires transaction management because several Internet of Things transactions may access shared data simultaneously. However, cloud transaction management methods cannot be employed in edge-cloud computing settings. Transaction management models must be consistent and consider ACIDity of transactions, especially consistency. This study compares three implementation strategies, Edge Host Strategy (EHS), Cloud Host Strategy (CHS), and Hybrid BHS (BHS), which execute all IoT transactions on the Edge host, the cloud, and both hosts, respectively. These transactions affect the Edge hosts as well. An IoTT framework is provided, viewing an Internet of Things transaction as a collection of fundamental and additional subtransactions that loosen atomicity. Execution strategy controls essential and additional subtransactions.The integration of edge and cloud computing demonstrates that the execution approach significantly affects system performance. EHS and CHS can waste wireless bandwidth, while BHS outperforms CHS and EHS in many scenarios. These solutions enable edge transactions to complete without restarting due to outdated IoT data or other edge or cloud transactions. The properties of these approaches have been detailed, showing that they often outperform concurrent protocols and can improve edge-cloud computing.},

abstract = {The agriculture is the backbone of economic system, and it plays an essential part in the survival of a nation’s prosperity. In addition to providing raw materials and food, it also offers numerous employment opportunities. Consequently, agriculture necessitates modern technology to increase productivity. In these circumstances, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used to detect climatic parameters like light, humidity, carbon dioxide, acidity, soil moisture, and temperature in an agricultural field. However, the research that is being done at the moment is unable to circumvent the issue that safety and effectiveness cannot coexist. Several studies employ time-consuming cryptographic security structures, whereas the majority of lightweight systems are designed without reviewing certain security aspects like resistance to ephemeral secret leakage (ESL) attacks, perfect forward secrecy, and so on. According to our opinion, this issue may be overcome through the use of lightweight cryptographic primitives, paying particular attention to protocol weaknesses, and keeping in mind the ever-changing security needs of individuals. We present an extensive lightweight three-factor authentication protocol with diverse security criteria, along with the adaptive privacy preservation, that is suited for user-friendly situation in the WSN enviroment. This is accomplished by removing all extraneous cryptographic structures. It has been illustrated that proposed protocol is much better in terms of the privacy and security aspects via the usage of security aspects, proof of the real-or-random (ROR) model, protocols of internet security, and applications that are subjected to experimental validation utilizing automated validation. and comparison with other protocols’ security aspects. The performance analysis shows how superior our proposed protocol is to other competing protocols in terms of communication and computational overheads, with respective efficiencies of 53% and 39%. Moreover, using the ROR model reveals that this study has benefits in performance compared with other competing research.},

abstract = {Many IoT applications rely on the timely collection and processing of data. Although the technology that allows data collection is readily available, its deployment on a large scale raises many practical issues, the main one probably being: who pays for the infrastructure? IoT deployment could significantly benefit from crowdsourcing: to ensure the successful deployment of a data collection infrastructure, it is crucial to motivate end users, as their active participation and engagement are key to the system's effectiveness and reach. This paper addresses these issues in a practical use case that deals with collecting environmental data. We propose a decentralized crowdsensing architecture where vehicles act as data collectors and transfer data from sources (e.g., sensing devices) to networked access points. The system provides economic incentives to individuals willing to act as data collectors or to operate gateways in the form of micropayments enabled by a blockchain. The proposed architecture is evaluated using a multilevel simulation model that combines existing communication, mobility, and behavioral sub-models. This reduces the time required to build a full simulator and potentially increases the accuracy of the results.},

abstract = {Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives are spearheaded to further stakeholders’ engagement apart from bolstering their trust in the government. OGD's adoption and usage is important in order to result in value creation and innovation initiatives by the stakeholders concerned. Therefore, academic interest has increased over the years to deepen our understanding regarding the stakeholders’ behavioral intention towards adoption and usage which includes a study of facilitating factors and the barriers both. Technology adoption and usage studies have underlined the influence of gender, perceived importance and usage experience and since OGD is being conceived as a ‘technology’, it is viable to understand the role of these three variables vis-a-vis OGD adoption and usage. With a sample drawn from the currently-enrolled students (‘actual’ OGD users only) pursuing their undergraduate and postgraduate courses (n∼530) at a leading private Indian university, the present study seeks to analyze the moderating effects of gender, perceived importance and usage experience towards the behavioral intention to adopt and use OGD. The relationships between the adapted Unified Theory of Technology Adoption and Use (UTAUT) model and the Behavioral Intention to adopt and use OGD are found to be impacted by the three moderators across Performance Expectancy and Information Quality as also between the males and the females. As a original contribution towards the OGD-focused research, it is anticipated that further research shall focus on other determinants linked with OGD adoption and usage.},

abstract = {Currently, software product becomes an essential component in running many stakeholders' activities. For instance, the industries mostly use cloud services to execute their important business functionality. However, by a few input's parameter interacting, this functionality can be pended. Such constraint poses challenging to cover various features of failure especially in ensuring cloud application. One way is to devise a strategy to cover input parameters' characteristics based on Combinatorial testing approach. This technique includes all possible combinations of test inputs for detecting bugs on the System Under Test (SUT). The paper explains the Combinatorial covering arrays to generate relatively exhaustive testing by modeling features of sample services using Feature IDE plugin in Eclipse IDE. This way, we build the input domain model to represent coverage of the existing mobility service running on NEMo Mobility cloud platform. Using this model, covering arrays is applied to generate t-way test cases by leveraging IPOg algorithm, which is implemented in a CiTLab. As a test case management, the JUnit testing framework uses test stubs to validate the test methods of generated test cases on the specified service (SUT).},

abstract = {Human-centered robotic applications are becoming pervasive in the context of robotics and smart manufacturing, and such a pervasiveness is even more expected with the shift to Industry 5.0. The always increasing level of autonomy of modern robotic platforms requires the integration of software applications from different domains to implement artificial intelligence, cognition, and human-robot/robot-robot interaction. Developing and (re)configuring such a multi-domain software to meet functional constraints is a challenging task. Even more challenging is customizing the software to satisfy non-functional requirements such as real-time, reliability, and energy efficiency. In this context, the concept of Edge-Cloud continuum is gaining consensus as a solution to address functional and non-functional constraints in a seamless way. Containerization and orchestration are becoming a standard practice, as they allow for better information flow among different network levels as well as increased modularity in the use of multi-domain software components. Nevertheless, the adoption of such a practice along the design flow, from simulation to the deployment of complex robotic applications by addressing the de facto development standards (e.g., ROS - Robotic Operating System) is still an open problem. We present a design methodology based on Docker and Kubernetes that enables containerization and orchestration of ROS-based robotic SW applications for heterogeneous and hierarchical HW architectures. The methodology aims at (i) integrating and verifying multi-domain components since early in the design flow, (ii) mapping software tasks to containers to minimize the performance and memory footprint overhead, (iii) clustering containers to efficiently distribute load across the edge-cloud architecture by minimizing resource utilization, and (iv) enabling multi-domain verification of functional and non-functional constraints before deployment. The article presents the results obtained with a real case of study, in which the design methodology has been applied to program the mission of a Robotnik RB-Kairos mobile robot in an industrial agile production chain. We have obtained reduced load on the robot’s HW with minimal performance and network overhead, thanks to the optimized distributed system.},

This design enables real-time cross-robot data acquisition and collaboration capabilities previously unattainable in MRS deployments. Our implementation integrates seamlessly with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and has been extensively evaluated using both physical UAV/UGV platforms and data servers. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSfs achieves a 7x reduction in online data query latency under wireless network conditions compared to conventional ROS storage methods, while simultaneously improving data freshness (Age of Information) by up to 271x. These advancements position ROSfs as a transformative solution for high-performance robotic data management in distributed systems.},

Today, such smart communities are highly heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and services only to their local community inhabitants. ComDeX uses property graphs to represent smart community entities and automatically maps them to context-aware publish/subscribe messages. Such messages can be discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated topology and an advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using well-known IoT technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic smart port scenario and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT scenarios with synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments where the number of hops between brokers of the federation increases.},

abstract = {IoT, Industry 4.0, and ubiquitous applications demand an intense exchange of information between actors (humans, animals, plants, or other objects) and things. Different interaction technologies, techniques, and methods can support it, including RFID, a well-known technology capable of identifying and locating actors. However, the variety of application domains and interaction possibilities jeopardize the use of RFID without a clear understanding of its usage issues. Therefore, we have performed a systematic mapping to characterize the adoption of RFID technology in this kind of interactive software system by intercepting human-computer interaction and software engineering issues. Our goal is to reveal (i) which application domains address RFID; (ii) why RFID is used instead of other technologies; (iii) who interacts through RFID and how the interaction is; (iv) what are the requirements and limitations associated with it; and (v) what are the common quality characteristics and measures which should be considered for their evaluation. The results showed that (i) RFID is specially used for implementing implicit interactions in healthcare, embedded systems, and manufacturing applications. (ii) Passive UHF RFID is usually adopted due to being contactless, low-cost, and well-performing indoors. (iii) It interacts with humans and things in the same proportion, most frequently to collect locations of sensor data constantly. (iv) RFID presents limitations, such as causing electromagnetic interference and not working well near metallic walls. However, tags work under high temperatures and can be well hidden in cement or clothes. (v) Interactive system designers usually create applications with invisible infrastructures, which tend to keep users' focus on the real world.?},

abstract = {More and more data-intensive systems have emerged lately. Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, or cloud-native applications all require high scalability and availability. Data is no longer persisted in one central relational database with serialized and transactional access, but rather distributed and replicated among different nodes running only under eventual consistency. This poses a number of design challenges for software architects, as they cannot rely on a single system to mask the concurrency anomalies of concurrent access to distributed and replicated data. Based on three case studies, we developed a theory regarding how practitioners handle synchronization and consistency design challenges in distributed data-intensive applications. We also identified the "white spots" of missing design guidance needed by practitioners to handle the aforementioned challenges appropriately. We are currently evaluating our theory in the context of an action research study. In this study, we are also evaluating the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard, which, according to our theory, meet the needs of practitioners. Our design guidelines integrate with Domain-Driven Design, which is widely used in practice. Following the idea of multilevel serializability, we investigate the compatibility of business operations beyond commutativity. We provide concrete practical design guidance to achieve compatibility of non-commutative business operations. We also describe the basic infrastructure guarantees our design guidelines require from replication frameworks.},

This case of study proposes an integrated model which sets the environment to reduce some critical indicators such as defective products (20%) or out-of-time delivery rate (60%). Those indicators are currently above the industry, and we pretend to make the company competitive by reducing 13% and 30% respectively after the validation. Using these results we can confirm the effectiveness of Kanban, JIT, and Standardized work as tools to improve the efficiency and Agility in production and warehouse management.},

abstract = {Spectral modeling plays a critical role in denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs), with recent approaches leveraging well-designed network architectures to extract spectral contexts for noise removal. However, these approaches overlook a striking finding: the presence of spectral differences in noisy contexts can pose challenges for the denoising network during the restoration process of each band in the HSI. We attribute this to the varying levels of spectral difference between different bands and the unknown distribution of various noises. These factors can make it difficult for the network to capture consistent features, ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose a novel concept termed 'spectral displacement,' which views spectral differences as pixel motion displacement along the spectral domain. To eliminate the effect of spectral displacement, we introduce a potential solution: spectral alignment. This approach can increase the mutual information between different spectral bands and enhance the effectiveness of denoising. We then present the Spectral Alignment Recurrent Network (SARN) for efficient and effective displacement estimation and pixel-level alignment between neighboring bands. SARN can serve as a general plug-in for HSI backbones without requiring any model-specific design. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our concept and network. The source code will be available at https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/SARN.},

abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), including blockchain, is increasingly used within industry ecosystems to create a high-integrity, single source of truth of shared data and business processes across diverse parties. A major challenge in adopting DLT is the conflicting demands on data transparency for improved integrity, against hiding commercially sensitive data. To address this, some industry ecosystems use multiple ledgers shared only between relevant parties rather than using a single distributed ledger across the entire ecosystem. The design problem for this is: What parties should share which ledgers, and what data should be on those ledgers? In this paper, we propose a method employing a Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and Domain Mapping Matrix (DMM) to derive candidate shared ledger combinations for industry ecosystems. The method also indicates, for certain data, centralized web services or point-to-point messages may be more suitable than shared ledgers. We discuss our experiences with applying this method while developing a prototype for an agricultural traceability platform. We also present a genetic-algorithm-based DSM and DMM clustering technique to derive candidate shared ledger combinations.},

abstract = {The conversion efficiency of scientific and technological achievements in China's universities is relatively low. Analysis and evaluation of the conversion efficiency of scientific and technological achievements in universities can find problems and propose suggestions for improvement. This article establishes a model for evaluating the conversion efficiency of scientific and technological achievements in universities based on the DEA method, and analyzes 42 universities in Guangdong Province as cases. The research results show that the efficiency evaluation model for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements of universities is an effective DEA efficiency measurement model. The overall efficiency of the transformation of scientific and technological achievements of universities in Guangdong Province is not high. Only 7 of 42 universities are DEA effective. The average pure technical efficiency of 211 universities is 0.935, which is higher than the non-211 universities of 0.584, but the scale efficiency of 42 universities is lower than 0.5. In addition, the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in universities in Guangdong Province has problems of redundant investment in R&amp;D personnel and insufficient income from technology transfer.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained much space in people’s everyday lives in the last few years, and it is already possible to see IoT applications widely used in various domains, such as healthcare and industry. The convergence of IoT and digital games also creates opportunities for HCI &amp; Digital Games research, supposedly opening countless possibilities for innovative games and challenging research. However, research on this topic appears to suffer from a generalized lack of clarity in its basics. Following this thread, we conducted a systematic mapping study and analyzed 22 papers that proposed or evaluated IoT games and gamified systems (IoTGGS), aiming to identify characteristics, patterns, and research opportunities related to HCI design and evaluation. However, our own frustrations in this endeavor also led us to identify shortcomings in commonly-used approaches. Thus, this paper contributes to the debate not only by focusing on the convergence between games and IoT with a systematic approach but also discussing the apparently dead-end we have found when closely analyzing this research topic. We present a brief panorama of the field and the identified gaps and raise possible new directions that could help take IoTGGS research to the next level.},

abstract = {This paper presents MilliSign, a guidance system based on a batteryless tag to support unmanned aerial vehicles in all-weather conditions. Conventional batteryless guidance systems using visual signs fail to work in inclement weather due to poor visibility. The need for all-weather operation with long-range readability encourages the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar, which poses challenges in providing a wide 3-D read range and low-cost operation. To address these challenges, we introduce a corner reflector (CR) array-based chipless RFID tag and a one-shot slant range reading procedure with COTS mmWave radar. We establish a novel design method for the shape and alignment of CR units to decrease the tag's size and expand the 3-D read range. Additionally, we develop a signal-processing pipeline based on Root-MUSIC to achieve accurate power and spatial estimation, which facilitate automatic tag detection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the tag, measuring 292 mm \texttimes{} 600 mm \texttimes{} 19 mm and storing 8 bits, can be read by mmWave radar from a distance of more than 10 m with a viewing angle of more than 30° in elevation and azimuth. Moreover, its performance remains stable in poor visibility conditions and multipath-rich environments.},

abstract = {Today's Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications often employ large-scale and dense sensor deployments for environmental monitoring. A hierarchical Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based architecture can facilitate power efficiency and reliability for data collection in dense networks. But if the network is static with fixed parameter settings, it can not be adaptable to dynamic application requirements. Although BLE is a parametric protocol, it does not provide any built-in feature for parameter tuning. To achieve network adaptability, we introduce and design SoftBLE, a Software Defined Networking (SDN) framework that provides controllability for BLE based 2-tier networks. It takes advantages of advanced control knobs recently available in BLE protocol stacks. SoftBLE is complemented by two orchestration algorithms to optimize gateway and sensor parameters. Evaluation results from both an experimental testbed and a large-scale simulation study show that almost all the SoftBLE sensors can save around 70% of transmission power while keeping Packet Reception Rate (PRR) above 99.9%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present CSPOT, a distributed runtime system implementing a functions-as-service (FaaS) programming model for the "Internet of Things" (IoT). With FaaS, developers express arbitrary computations as simple functions that are automatically invoked and managed by a cloud platform in response to events. We extend this FaaS model so that it is suitable for use in all tiers of scale for IoT - sensors, edge devices, and cloud - to facilitate robust, portable, and low-latency IoT application development and deployment.To enable this, we combine the use of Linux containers and namespaces for isolation and portability, an append-only object store for robust persistence, and a causal event log for triggering functions and tracking event dependencies. We present the design and implementation of CSPOT, detail its abstractions and APIs, and overview examples of its use. We empirically evaluate the performance of CSPOT using different devices and applications and find that it implements function invocation with significantly lower latency than other FaaS offerings, while providing portability across tiers and similar data durability characteristics.},

abstract = {Shared use of small-scale natural commons is vital to the livelihoods of billions of rural inhabitants, particularly women, and advocates propose that local telecommunications systems that are oriented by the commons can close rural connectivity gaps. This article extends insights about women's exclusion from such Community Networks (CNs) by considering ‘commoning’, or practices that produce, reproduce and use the commons and create communality. I generated data in interviews and observations of rural CNs in seven countries in the Global South and in multi-sited ethnography of international advocacy for CNs. Male biases in technoculture and rural governance limit women's participation in CNs, and women adopt different approaches to performing their communal identity while using technology. This situation contributes to detaching CNs from relations that are produced in women's commoning. It also illustrates processes that co-opt the commons in rural technology endeavours and the diverse ways commoners express their subjectivities in response.},
