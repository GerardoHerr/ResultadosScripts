abstract = {Digital twins of complex systems are operated by stakeholders from different domains, who typically do not work in the same language. This problem is exacerbated in digital twins where domain-specific representations are required to convey actionable results, such as in cyber-biophysical systems. Particularly, in controlled environment agriculture, agronomists devise seasonal production plans and run simulations to optimize the system in terms of crop phenology while growers maintain crops and ensure their optimal growth by assessing crop morphology. To breach this gap, we consider an optimization problem to reconcile the different users' points of views. We propose a modeling methodology that bridges the gap between crop phenology and morphology, generating visual representations of crops based on simulated phenological characteristics. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed methodology for digital twins in smart farming, we apply our approach to two case studies: a strawberry vertical farm and a smart canola field.},

abstract = {Access to the Internet is a crucial enabler for many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Unfortunately, a significant part of the world’s population is left behind due to the lack of access to a reliable and affordable Internet connection. Satellites have the potential to impact the current market of Internet services significantly. In particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites promise high-bandwidth without compromising latency. They can be employed in 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (e.g., IoT connectivity, connected autonomous driving, communication in rural areas, and more). Smart farming and precise agriculture (even remotely controlled), especially in underdeveloped areas, are compelling use cases for LEO satellites. In these scenarios, high bandwidth and low latency are required to facilitate both quick transmission of images/videos and prompt remote control of drones, tractors, actuators, etc. This study compares different TCP protocols based on their performance over satellite communication in a smart farming case study. It also proposes and analyzes a solution leveraging on a limited buffer size to maintain a high throughput while lowering per-packet delays.},

abstract = {Smart systems have become key solutions for many application areas including autonomous farming. The trend we can see now in the smart systems is that they shift from single isolated autonomic and self-adaptive components to larger ecosystems of heavily cooperating components. This increases the reliability and often the cost-effectiveness of the system by replacing one big costly device with a number of smaller and cheaper ones. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of synergistic collaboration among autonomic components in the domain of smart farming---in particular, the use-case we employ in the demonstration stems from the AFar-Cloud EU project. We exploit the concept of autonomic component ensembles to describe situation-dependent collaboration groups (so called ensembles). The paper shows how the autonomic component ensembles can easily capture complex collaboration rules and how they can include both controllable autonomic components (i.e. drones) and non-controllable environment agents (flocks of birds in our case). As part of the demonstration, we provide an open-source implementation that covers both the specification of the autonomic components and ensembles of the use case, and the discrete event simulation and real-time visualization of the use case. We believe this is useful not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of architectures of collaborative autonomic components for dealing with real-life tasks, but also to build further experiments in the domain.},

Smart farming is a cycle of intelligent detection and monitoring, analysis and planning, as well as control of agricultural operations using a cloud-based event management system. In this paper, we propose WALLeSMART, a cloud-based framework built to capitalize the efforts invested in building smart farming management systems, applied to the Wallonia region of Belgium. The framework proposes an architecture to address the challenges of acquisition, processing, and visualization of massive amounts of data, in both batch and real-time basis.

However, there is a gap in the field of domain-specific modeling regarding reusable components at the model level. While libraries are relatively common and a de facto standard for prominent programming languages, establishing model libraries is still in its infancy. This paper specifies building a model-driven component library that utilizes a self-extension mechanism. We demonstrate an approach to structure, build, and integrate such a library using a wide range of GUI components, from essential atomic elements and more complex composed components to specifically tailored ones for particular application domains. Employing such libraries at the model level further supports the goal of model-driven engineering to assist domain experts in efficiently building high-quality systems.},

abstract = {Background: The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm involves a network of devices that exchange data through the Internet. Defining IoT systems’ requirements addresses their functionality, device interactions, and data integration while meeting stakeholder needs. Design Thinking (DT) may support this process with its user-centered techniques. However, further empirical validation is needed to ensure their effectiveness in IoT software development. Aims: We aim to investigate two DT techniques, IoThinking and Mind IoT, in supporting the requirement elicitation phase for IoT systems, thus improving the development of better IoT systems. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment with 59 software engineering students to assess the effectiveness of both IoThinking and Mind IoT techniques in supporting the requirements elicitation phase for IoT systems. We measured the effectiveness based on the number of requirements each method helped derive. We also conducted a Focus Group with 15 participants to verify their perceptions of the techniques. Results: We found no statistical difference in the number of requirements derived by the two techniques, suggesting that both are equally effective. However, participants’ feedback suggested IoThinking is recommended during the requirements elicitation phase and appropriate for smaller, simpler projects. Mind IoT has its use recommended after an initial elicitation, helping on refine and map out established requirements. Conclusions: Our findings can guide software engineers in choosing the appropriate technique based on their IoT projects’ specific needs and scope.},

abstract = {With the advent of modern smart farming and agritech technology, farms are increasingly becoming an example of a cyber-physical system (CPS). For example, a modern dairy farm will feature internet-of-things (IoT) devices for monitoring animals and fully automated milking parlors. When considering the cyber security of CPS, we often talk about critical national infrastructure (CNI) with a focus on heavy industries such as energy generation, water treatment, and manufacturing, which all have a long history of digitization. Food supply is also considered part of CNI, so it is essential to consider it. A cyber attack on a farm can impact food supply, reduce revenue for farmers, and impact animal welfare. The security of smart farming has not been widely explored, and there is a lack of realistic testbeds that evaluate the security of agritech devices. This paper discusses the design of such a testbed, focusing on the dairy farming sector. We provide an overview of the testbed and discuss the challenges and lessons learned during the design and build process. We also present some early results from our analysis of the devices and software within the testbed and discuss future research directions.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas (GHG) from farms. It ac-counts for about 70% of the warming effect of agricultural emissions. N2O is produced mainly from excess available nitrogen from ap-plying fertilizer as nitrate compounds in soils. One way to reduce N2O emissions is to apply fertilizer prudently. Fertilizers can be applied to the crop more efficiently by adding enough at the right place and time to meet crop demands, thus avoiding excess amounts left over. The above goal could be achieved using the appropriate farming practice. Two farming practices were investigated: con-ventional broadcasting and innovative strip-tilling. Experimental results show that the “Innovative Strip-tilling” is more effective than “Conventional Broadcasting”. This new farming practice requires 33% less fertilizer than conventional broadcast farming practice and yet provides an average of 25% increase in yield and an average 35% increase in profit. It also resulted in a more than 90% decrease in nitrous oxide emissions in 2021 and 2022.},

We focus on e-NAM, or the electronic National Agricultural Market, a state-sponsored digital trading platform intended to create a transparent, efficient, and frictionless online national agricultural market by collapsing geographical barriers of traditional marketplaces, commonly known as mandis. We found that despite e-NAM’s intended benefits, mandis continue to be the preferred mode of transaction for trading agricultural commodities. We demonstrate that these two agricultural marketplaces foster different meanings of information transparency, efficiency, and participation among stakeholders. In agrarian societies dominated by smallholder farmers, such as India, social collectives and non-economic relationships are crucial for providing safety and risk mitigation when dealing with perishable commodities like onions. We argue that e-NAM fails because its digital intermediation prioritizes an ahistorical and depoliticized free-market approach, which treats farmers (and traders) as independent units driven solely by the economic logic of demand and supply, disconnecting them from their historical and political agrarian social class.},

This research aims to assist in facilitating the cultivation of soilless vegetables by adopting Internet of Things, Edge computing and Cloud computing technologies to plant hydroponics vegetables. Today people are interested in consuming more hydroponics vegetables. Also, hydroponics vegetables are expensive on the market. This hydroponics vegetable cabinet is made so that they can be grown at home without buying from the market and fresh. This smart vegetable cabinet can control various electrical appliances within the cabinet for example, water pump control, LED Grow Light control and automatic ventilator operation at the set value. Moreover, we can check various component values inside the cabinet such as pH, EC in water, humidity and temperature inside the cabinet. In addition, they can control devices, check their values, take photos, or view images from a web page. This vegetable grower can be planted in inaccessible places such as homes or restaurants. This vegetable grower utilizes the Grow Light LED, which provides the light that plants need. Also, this intelligent vegetable grower is not very large, easy to move, suitable for those who have less space but want to grow their own vegetables. The results from the research are satisfactory.},

abstract = {Despite representing a significant percentage of economic growth, the food sector in Peru faces numerous challenges. Companies in this sector confront issues such as low efficiency in their production lines, high delay times, poorly maintained work areas, and high machinery downtime. This article explores solutions using Lean Manufacturing tools such as work study, 5S, Poka Yoke, and TPM with an IoT approach. Additionally, a pilot program will be implemented using the 8-step change management model to assess and quantify improvements in order to established performance parameters. By analyzing a company struggling with efficiency, it evaluates how Lean Manufacturing tools can enhance workflow and competitiveness. The aim of this research is to implement Lean Manufacturing tools to enhance the efficiency of a food sector company. To achieve this, key objectives must be considered, including optimizing workflow through process standardization and reducing machinery downtime through TPM - Planned Maintenance to improve efficiency by 3.58%. It is expected that the final outcome exceeds this percentage and that it improves over time, as the tools employed have the potential to further boost the company's efficiency.},

This is especially crucial during the farrowing period, where mother sows and their newborn piglets are housed together to facilitate nursing. Existing weight measurement methods, however, either provide only sporadic snapshots or have scalability and reliability issues in the harsh environment of industrial farms. This paper presents MassHog, a multi-layered system for ubiquitous weight measurement in harsh environments, such as pig pens, using structural vibrations. MassHog combines an existing sensor concept with actuated vibrations to weigh both piglets and adult hogs together. We evaluate the components of this system through testing deployments, including at real-world operating pig farms. Preliminary results show less than 2&nbsp;kg mean absolute error for adult hogs.},

Implications for commercial agtech carrying these dominant values are that emerging agtech may continue to exploit racialized labor and exclude sustainable farming priorities. My research investigates how these labor production systems, which have historically been used for commercial farming practices, may be redirected to support more sustainable and socially equitable farming. My project is situated between Ontario, Canada, where the largest concentration of migrant farmers work and Oaxaca, Mexico, the home state of many migrant farmers employed in Ontario. I rely upon qualitative and design research methods to explore how migrant farmers are affected by agtech, how migrant farmers’ agricultural knowledge and expertise are interpreted and used transnationally, and how Canadian growers and agtech designers envision how migrant labor fits into alternative food system futures.},

PLF is concerned with the development of new technologies to improve livestock farming operations and outcomes, including improving the health and welfare of farm animals. However, unlike ACI, which has roots in the human-computer interaction field and thus incorporates many user-centred design methodological traditions, PLF research has emerged largely from engineering fields and is highly technology-focused. This work-in-progress paper discusses the opportunities to apply research and methodologies emerging from the ACI field to help improve the usability and overall utility of PLF technologies for both its human and animal users. We also discuss several ongoing projects from our research group that take this approach.},

abstract = {Fodder rape is a good quality feed crop, and it can effectively alleviate the problem of lack of green feed for livestock in winter and spring. Because of high water content and crispy texture of fodder rape, there is a lack of applicable harvesting machinery in Mid-lower Yangtze River in China. Cylinder-type cutterhead and articulated-type cutterhead for a fresh fodder rape harvester were designed to solve the problems. The working processes were analyzed and an innovative mechanical system was designed. The effects of the two kinds of cutterheads were compared and analyzed by bench tests. Based on the results of the experiments, the average length of the stems after chopping by both cutterheads meets the requirements for fodder, the length uniformity of the cylinder-type cutterhead is better than that of the articulated-type cutterhead; the average energy consumption of the articulated-type is less than that of the cylinder-type, but the stability and reliability of the cylinder-type is better than that of the articulated-type. When the feed rate of the harvester was in the range of 5~9 kg/s, the average length of the materials cut by the cylinder-type cutterhead ranged from 49.91mm to 65.64 mm, the length uniformity ranged from 77.42 % ~ 82.09 %, which met the feeding requirements of fresh fodder rape. The results show that the materials harvested by the cylinder-type cutterhead can meet the requirements of winter and spring fresh feeding of rape, which can significantly reduce the labor cost of feeding, improve the efficiency and the materials utilization rate. This research could provide a reference for the improvement of chopping device for fresh fodder rapeseed in winter and spring.},

This study focuses on assessing the development of modern logistics in Sichuan Province and its role in improving regional economic performance, identifying the impact of specific industries. The interaction between the modern logistics industry and economic growth is examined using cointegration model analysis. Economic growth in Sichuan Province is clearly influenced by the upgrading of the modern logistics industry, which maintains a long-term stable equilibrium with GDP and logistics indicators such as express and waterway freight volumes. The study shows that economic growth promotes the development of the modern logistics industry, and vice versa. The Granger causality test shows that the adjustment of express and waterway freight volume unilaterally affects GDP growth, indicating that the increase of express volume and the decrease of waterway freight volume promote the long-term GDP growth of Sichuan Province. The article puts forward policy suggestions such as seizing the opportunity of "Belt and Road", introducing new technologies to build a digital logistics system, and accelerating industrial integration to create a logistics industry ecosystem, in order to promote the coordinated upgrading of the modern logistics industry and regional economy in Sichuan Province.},

After describing the problem and reviewing the related literature, a simulation-based optimization approach is introduced and tested via a series of computational experiments. Our approach combines biased-randomization techniques with a simheuristic framework to make use of data provided by smart sensor devices located at the top of each farm silo. From the analysis of results, some managerial insights are also derived and a new business model is proposed.},

Recent works try to mitigate these issues by creating solutions that abstract the complexity of the systems, such as using visual programming languages. Node-RED, as one of the most common solutions for the visual development IoT systems, stills has several limitations, such as the lack of observability and inadequate debugging mechanisms. In this work, we address some of these limitations by enhancing Node-RED with new features that improve the user's system development, debugging, and understanding tasks. We proceed to empirically evaluate the impact of these enhancements, concluding that, overall, such enhancements reduce the development time and the number of failed attempts to deploy the system.},

abstract = {RFID is a smart label technology that is used in several real-life applications such as inventory management, asset tracking, personnel tracking, controlling access to restricted areas, ID badging, supply chain management, counterfeit prevention (e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry), and smart farming. Generally, the data collection of RFIDs consists of the users’ visited locations and their visiting time, so called as trajectory datasets. Aside from applications, trajectory datasets can also be released for public use. For this reason, they could lead to being privacy violation issues. To address these issues in trajectory datasets, LKC-Privacy is proposed. Unfortunately, in this work, we demonstrate that LKC-Privacy still has a serious vulnerability that must be improved. To rid the demonstrated vulnerability of LKC-Privacy, a privacy preservation model is proposed in this work. Furthermore, the proposed mode is evaluated by extensive experiments. From the experimental results, they indicate that the proposed model is highly secure and more efficient than LKC-Privacy.},

abstract = {Batteryless devices are gaining widespread adoption as they eliminate batteries through energy harvesting. This not only reduces electronic waste but also facilitates sensing and monitoring in physically inaccessible or challenging environments, such as implantable devices, smart agriculture, and forests. Thus, batteryless devices are increasingly being integrated into Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as smart homes, healthcare, and agricultural systems, as well as cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as industrial plants and wearable technologies. In these contexts, batteryless devices often handle privacy-sensitive information and must interact seamlessly and securely with both other batteryless devices and traditional battery-powered devices to share data and perform tasks.In this paper, we first identify the unique security and privacy challenges associated with batteryless devices. We then analyze the existing security and privacy solutions within the IoT and CPS domains, highlighting their limitations when applied to batteryless devices. Lastly, we propose new research directions at the intersection of sensing, IoT, security, and privacy to address the operational requirements of batteryless devices. This paper is an important step forward in protecting the security and privacy of batteryless devices as well as their integration into IoT systems and CPS.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic poses great challenges to the resilience of global agriculture in response to disasters or crises. The pandemic mitigation measures prevent the spread of coronavirus but bring disruptions to the agriculture sector. Smallholder farmers and small agricultural producer particularly showed their vulnerability to these disruptions amid the pandemic. Technology innovations can be adopted to develop resilient, flexible and inclusive agriculture. Blockchain enables autonomous and decentralized coordination of trust in a distributed network without any trusted third-party intermediaries that can vastly reduce the transaction costs of exchange and trade. This paper examines the viable applications of blockchain technology in enhancing the resilience of agriculture and the food supply chain, facilitating trades and financing, and driving value allocation from a perspective of institutional economics.},

abstract = {Cloud of Things (CoT) is a new paradigm that explores the synergy between Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing and has increasingly promoted the development of complex software-intensive systems in diverse and even critical application domains. In parallel, reference architectures have contributed as a means to capture the knowledge of how to develop, standardize, and evolve software-intensive systems and, as a consequence, have promoted quality issues in different domains. However, there is still a lack of investigation on reference architectures for CoT, which could be impacting the lack of standardization in CoT systems. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to present an overview of reference architectures for CoT and, for this, we conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) and found eight architectures proposed quite recently in different application domains. As a result, these architectures have advanced mainly in terms of standardization, but they have not still large dissemination and wider adoption by the software industry. Several open issues can be pointed out, including actions to promote the sustainability of these architectures.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a relevant topic of interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) since it makes feasible a future computing scenario that can change the way people experiment and use technology. IoT is a new paradigm in which intelligent objects equipped with sensors, networks, and processing technologies integrate and work together to provide smart services to users. In the face of the rapid growth in the number of connected devices in an IoT scenario, the perspective of a smarter world could be actual. However, it is still too far away due to challenges related to human interaction. To help understand the issues involved in building experiences with multiple devices, we conducted interviews with ten companies exploring the characteristics and challenges surrounding the IoT project to designing IoT technologies. The results identified a set of qualitative data from companies that are developing IoT projects allowing us to discuss future directions for research. Our main contribution is related to the identification of important aspects of IoT that impact the design of user-friendly solutions. We conclude pointing to the need for IoT design that takes into account the users' particularities.},

Odisha's agricultural sector, crucial for the state's economy and employing over 45% of its workforce, faces low productivity and resource-intensive practices. The KSK utilizes analytics, live surveys, and a dedicated team to monitor program implementation, plant protection, and policy reforms. Real-time data access empowers officials, while nudges and escalations based on performance indicators ensure timely action. Stakeholder surveys and feedback analysis are conducted for continuous improvement. This research employs a mixed-methods approach to assess the KSK's impact on monitoring, feedback mechanisms, and policy agility in Odisha, considering its influence on various stakeholders and the broader agricultural landscape. Since its inception, the Krushi Samiksha Kendra has conducted over 500 surveys targeting various groups, contributing to the improvement of numerous policies and initiatives. It has identified and addressed over 2700 instances of pest incidence before they escalated to critical levels. Additionally, it has enhanced recorded scheme achievement by approximately 40% and officials' attendance in department forums by about 30%. Moreover, it has implemented real-time crop advisories during pest and weather emergencies, ensuring timely support to farmers.},

It can result in over or under irrigation, which could have a negative impact on crop yield and quality. In this paper, we provide the architectural design and implementation of a smart irrigation system that uses a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based on Arduino and XBee technologies. The system monitors agricultural conditions and automatically controls the soil moisture level in the root zone to keep it within its optimal range. The implementation of the WSN is provided. A comparison of the amount of water consumed between the smart system and the conventional irrigation approach are discussed. Our results obtained using a pilot prototype indicates that a significant amount of water-saving can be obtained when using a smart irrigation system instead of the conventional approach.

Today, such smart communities are highly heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and services only to their local community inhabitants. ComDeX uses property graphs to represent smart community entities and automatically maps them to context-aware publish/subscribe messages. Such messages can be discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated topology and an advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using well-known IoT technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic smart port scenario and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT scenarios with synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments where the number of hops between brokers of the federation increases.},

Through a mixed-methods study of 324 survey respondents and 81 interviews, we present data that demonstrates the significance and shape of “social agriculture” in the Kenyan agricultural landscape. We complement previous ICT4D/HCI4D literature that has primarily focused on purpose-built agricultural platforms through a novel focus on farmers’ appropriation of existing social media platforms to enter the agricultural sector and diversify agricultural livelihoods. Our study highlights new insights into the growing phenomenon of using social media platforms for agriculture practice, including how these platforms afford particular practices around the buying and selling of produce and information on social media platforms. We also identify challenges around trust and online abuse and describe the strategies employed by participants to counter them. Lastly, we build on our findings to highlight the affordances and constraints of using social media platforms, thus contributing to the field an initial conceptualization of social agriculture as a space of commerce. We offer eight design considerations for both technology designers and international development stakeholders to strengthen the potential for social platforms to afford social agricultural practices that enrich individual lives and livelihoods.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 initiative envisions the flexible and optimized production of customized products on Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) that consist of subsystems coordinated to conduct complex production processes. Hence, accurate CPPS modeling requires integrating the modeling of variability for Product-Process-Resource (PPR) aspects. Yet, current variability modeling approaches treat structural and behavioral variability separately, leading to inaccurate CPPS production models that impede CPPS engineering and optimization. This paper proposes a PhD project for integrated variability modeling of PPR aspects to improve the accuracy of production models with variability for CPPS engineers and production optimizers. The research project follows the Design Science approach aiming for the iterative design and evaluation of (a) a framework to categorize currently incomplete and scattered models and methods for PPR variability modeling as a foundation for an integrated model; and (b) a modeling approach for more accurate integrated PPR variability modeling. The planned research will provide the Software Product Line (SPL) and CPPS engineering research communities with (a) novel models, methods, and insights on integrated PPR variability modeling, (b) open data from CPPS engineering use cases for common modeling, and (c) empirical data from field studies for shared analysis and evaluation.},

In an IoD environment, the deployed drones and the ground station server (GSS) communicate over an open network which leads to security and privacy breaches. To mitigate these issues, a blockchain driven authentication and key establishment protocol for secure communication in IoD has been designed (in short, it is called as BAKP-IoDA). The security analysis of BAKP-IoDA shows its robustness against different attacks. During the performance comparison, it has been observed that BAKP-IoDA maintains superior security along with extra functionality features with the competing schemes. Additionally, the blockchain based practical demonstration of BAKP-IoDA shows its impact on various important network performance parameters, like computation time and transactions per second.},

The results show that: ① The digital economy and agricultural modernization grow at the same pace, and the digital economy grows faster than agricultural modernization from 2019 onwards. ② The degree of coupling coordination between the two systems reaches the state of high-quality coordination in 2021 from the state of extreme dysfunction in 2013, in which the four provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Jiangsu always score ahead. Based on this, it is proposed to accelerate the promotion of new rural infrastructure and cultivate digital agricultural talents in order to promote the integrated development of digital economy and agricultural modernization.},

abstract = {Precision Agricultural Technology (PAT) is a tool used by farmers in carrying out their agricultural activities. It can support the application of precision agriculture, so it is hoped that sustainability will be realized in agriculture. It is not easy to adopt new technology, especially in agricultural organizations in various countries, where there is a tendency for organizations to be comfortable with traditional and manual farming methods. This study has designed an adoption model by determining the factors supporting adopting new PAT in agricultural organizations that can lead to sustainability in agriculture. This research builds a theoretical framework and research model, starting with a systematic literature review. The agricultural expert from the Indonesian Research Institute for Tea and Cinchona (IRITC) responded to the research model, resulting in several suggestions and improvements. The variables used in this research are financial, pressure, and farm dimensions. The results of this study can be utilized as a reference in determining strategies that can increase the adoption of PAT so that it can direct agriculture in the world towards more precise agriculture.},

abstract = {Persistent surveillance is an essential tool in many damage prevention and mitigation scenarios. Existing approaches to conduct surveillance over an area either require deploying static equipment on the ground or are expensive and have a high ecological footprint. The era of commercial drones has facilitated the development of lightweight, agile vehicles that can carry a wide variety of payloads with a very low ecological footprint. In this paper, we present a new airborne surveillance system using drone swarms. We explore the concept of Swarm Utility and present a mobility model for persistent surveillance that achieves maximum utility while being energy efficient. We program the drones in the swarm to follow trajectories defined by the model, eliminating the need to control the drones manually. Additionally, we augment our system with an object detection framework that runs on accumulated video feed streamed by the swarm to detect objects of interest in the area with high accuracy.},

abstract = {With the growing demands of sustainability in the environment, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are implemented in almost every monitoring zone, like agriculture, disasters, medical purposes, etc., wherever it is difficult to cover a large area in a limited amount of time in a fast manner. So sustainability was achieved and eased with UAS, but with its new boon, it also suffers from issues with energy sources due to its high mobility. Conventionally, mobile devices create the network in 2D, named ,mobile adhoc network (MANET), but due to fast and high coverage, the new refined system with high flexibility created flying adhoc network (FANET). But the UAS running on battery power suffers from battery drain due to this drastic mobility. Since the UAS completely fly and communicate with routing management, most of the FANET utilises AODV routing, where communication is held through the hello packets, whose intervals are critical to maintain, which were seen being trivially transmitted periodically without indeed. Thus, a new adaptive velocity-based hello interval method was proposed that transmits the hello packet in the peer network according to the speed of the UAS, so the wastage of energy at non-required points could be saved. This would improve the battery power, which would elongate the flight time, as well as their network performance. The scheme is tested over NS3.27, where it results in saving about 4-8% energy and getting benefits in throughput and end-to-end delays as well.},

abstract = {The construction of power system sensing network requires high reliability, long-distance and low-cost sensing network. The characteristics of Long Range (LoRa) are very suitable for the construction of new power systems. However, LoRa is vulnerable to be attacked by jammer. In order to ensure the security and stability of the network, it is necessary to study the anti-jamming technology of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). In practice, it is difficult to know the jamming mode of jammer clearly, but reinforcement learning can effectively deal with jamming attacks without knowing the jamming model. In this paper, an anti-jamming strategy based on reinforcement learning is proposed to cope with jamming in power system sensing network. The scheme takes the total system capacity as a utility function. Facing unknown jamming models in power system sensing network, reinforcement learning can obtain the optimal anti-jamming scheme through continuous trial and error, and can improve the total system capacity. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation. Compared with the random anti-jamming strategy, anti-jamming scheme based on reinforcement learning is found to be effective against jamming and the total system capacity is greatly improved.},

In the complex and dynamic agricultural environment, the development of agricultural information monitoring technology and systems continues to face numerous challenges. Addressing this situation, this paper focuses on the key technology for agricultural information monitoring in greenhouse environments. First, based on Arduino and Zigbee technology, an agricultural information collection system composed of data collection nodes and gateway nodes is constructed. This system features a wide range of sensor interfaces, diverse data interaction methods, and robust data transmission capabilities. Second, the deployment of the agricultural information monitoring system in a greenhouse environment is analyzed in-depth, and corresponding deployment strategies are proposed.

Results show a misalignment between the expected and the actual course of the workshop, creating a difficult experience for the workshop facilitator. This gap finds its roots in a lack of problem framing. Perspectives are proposed to better understand and support the design activities in the agroliving lab.},

This assumption is standard in the existing link performance models for 5G in ns-3. The proposed implementation is based on an openly available modified fork of the ns-3 mmwave module with support for Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) SDMA.

abstract = {Bangladesh is predominantly an agrarian and patriarchal society where women have traditionally been left behind since it came into being. Besides, climate change's effects on agriculture push them far behind due to its negative impact on society. However, several rules, regulations, and programs formulated and implemented by both government and NGOs have helped them significantly reduce the gap. The current study aims to suggest a framework that can help reduce gender divides through digital farming in the agriculture sector of Bangladesh. Half of the population of Bangladesh is comprised of women who are contributing a lot to the economy nowadays in different ways, and this study only focuses on women in the agriculture sector to minimize the gap and empower them through digital farming. The general objective of the study is to configure a framework that can be used in Bangladesh to reduce gender divides through digital farming. The research goal is to address the challenges triggering the gender divide in the field with a spotlight on empowering women. The study follows the desk research methodology. It is expected that the findings of the study may contribute to reducing gender divides and empowering them in agriculture through digital farming.},

This system is divided into hardware end and software end. The hardware end includes data acquisition module, control processing module, speech recognition control module, and network deployment module. The data collection module uses LoRa technology for self-organizing networks and data collection, collecting temperature and humidity, CO, CO2, and TVOC concentrations. The control processing module is composed of LoRa core board equipped with corresponding decision actuators, such as ventilation execution and humidification execution. The speech recognition control module is composed of an STM32 gateway connected to an ASRPRO chip, responsible for parsing and executing speech content and sending it to the control processing module. The networking module consists of multiple LoRa core boards, STM32 gateways, and Wi Fi modules. It is responsible for using LoRa self-organizing network technology to network and obtain unified data, and using MQTT to collect and organize the collected data before sending it to Alibaba Cloud servers for storage. We have developed an Android APP using Android Studio on the software side. By connecting to the Alibaba Cloud platform, we can obtain hardware data, view the collected data, and perform control processing. We can dynamically view the air quality in the room and receive different control processing reminders.

abstract = {Backscatter communication is well-suited for agriculture, forest sensing, and environmental monitoring due to its low power and maintenance requirements. It can support a range of applications, including reading sensor values such as soil moisture or nutrient levels, monitoring plant health, tracking animal movements, or detecting forest fires. In these settings, sensors and backscatter nodes are often placed deep in the forest or under the plant canopy, while the reader is positioned on a mobile node such as a drone flying above the canopy. Consequently, signal attenuation caused by canopy blockage remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the feasibility of using backscatter communication in such environments and argues that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not the most reliable metric for evaluating link quality. Instead, we propose a new metric, called template correlation, which provides a more accurate assessment in low-SNR conditions. Our findings demonstrate that backscatter communication, with its low power consumption and minimalist hardware design at the tags, is effective for environmental monitoring, even in the presence of canopy attenuators like grasses or crops.},

Notwithstanding recent advancements, the conventional relay-centric communication paradigms grapple with scalability and optimal performance issues. In this paper, we introduce MeAnt ---a versatile IoT platform uniquely architected to foster seamless cross-medium communication by leveraging the compact design of piezoelectric-based mechanical antennas (Piezo-MAs). By capitalizing on the propagation attributes of medium-frequency radios emitted from Piezo-MAs, MeAnt promises communication across diverse environments such as air, water, soil, concrete, and even biological tissue, all while maintaining a compact antenna footprint. Moreover, in light of challenges such as potential interference from AM broadcasts and the intrinsic unidirectional nature of Piezo-MAs, we have developed a finely crafted full-stack communication protocol. Comprehensive tests underscore the system's proficiency, demonstrating a penetration depth of up to 10 m in cross-medium environments and realizing a throughput of 8.7 kbps.},

abstract = {Indiana grapples with worsening food deserts, underscored by an increase in its food insecurity rate from 9.4% in May 2020 to 13.4% in December 2022, [1] this study investigates the potential of technology to bridge market information gaps and enhance self-sustainability in communities. Existing research focuses on trade and policy reform, and infrastructure investment as interventions to solve food insecurity but overlooks the importance of comprehensive market information dissemination, a gap highlighted by organizations like the FAO and the World Bank. To bridge this gap, our research involved user studies with farmers, food banks, and low-income consumers through surveys, interviews, and low-fidelity evaluations. This approach helped uncover key issues of affordability and market accessibility as underlying barriers to an on-ground solution. We developed Project GreenBasket in response to the aforementioned problems, an online marketplace featuring direct sales channels for farmers, an affordable click-and-collect model for pick-up locations for consumers, and SNAP and nutrition tracking for relevant stakeholders working towards food security. GreenBasket not only addresses the identified gaps in literature but also aims to enhance food security and equity in Indiana, contributing towards the Sustainable Development Goals of Zero Hunger. Our findings reveal the significant potential of technology in improving market access and efficiency, showcasing a scalable model to combat food insecurity.},

abstract = {Promoting the economic development of ecological parks, improving the operation economy and input-output ratio of ecological parks are important goals of the construction of smart ecological parks. However, economic construction will cause varying degrees of damage to the operating environment of ecological parks, which is contrary to the low-carbon and environmental protection operation concept of smart ecological parks. To reduce the impact of the economic development of the smart ecological park on the operating environment of the park, this article puts forward a low-carbon operation model of the smart ecological park considering the collaboration of low-carbon ecology and biomass energy. Based on the improved integrated energy system formed by the coupling of IEEE-39-bus power distribution system, 20-bus gas supply system and 14-bus heat supply system, the simulation is verified. NSGA-III algorithm is used to solve the optimization model, and the effectiveness of the optimization operation strategy proposed in this article is verified.},

abstract = {Spatial queries in IoT-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks enable the interrogation of specific areas using various geometric shapes such as rectangles or circles. Based on how spatial queries have been designed to be processed, the numerous approaches proposed to tackle this issue can be categorized into parallel and serial query- ing. On one hand, serial approaches have been proven to be more efficient in this context, but on the other hand, they are unable to handle deployments with communication voids. In particular, they fail to visit all nodes located inside the targeted windows, and thus fail to guarantee query completeness/accuracy. To fill this gap, which to the extent of our knowledge has not been addressed by any of the state-of-the-art approaches, we present in this paper, a novel serial approach that has been designed to handle all net- work topologies, including sparse, dense, large, hole-free, and more specifically topologies with communication voids. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed ap- proach in terms of time and energy, and show that it can ensure the accuracy of window queries under various topology conditions and changes.},

abstract = {The growing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically referred to as drones, poses new challenges on how to manage their operations in various internet of things (IoT) use cases such as surveillance and monitoring, weather prediction, agriculture, etc. The latter includes a massive number of devices that sometimes produce invalid messages due to lack of energy or system shutdown and needs to be autonomously monitored with drones in rural areas. In this paper, we develop a blockchain-based platform for managing drone IoT operations while maintaining trust and security. The test-bed consists of IoT devices, a drone and blockchain-enabled gateways through which drones are controlled to replace malfunctioning devices. The latter are detected using Z-score observation algorithm which launches a smart contract and sends the drone with clear operation order. The results obtained in realistic agriculture use case highlight the utility of our proposition in decreasing signaling and operation time, improving the percentage of successful maintenance operations and providing trust and security when managing drones in an autonomous manner.},

abstract = {Because of the phenomenal growth of internet connectivity and unceasing improvements over hardware and software technology, everything is connected without any boundaries creating the Internet of Things, which becomes part of cyberspace. As the volume of cyberspace is overgrowing, the attackers' capabilities and strategies to find new vulnerabilities are increasing too. In order to defend the attackers from stealing and poisoning critical information of cyberspace, it is crucial to implement Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). However, it is not a straightforward process to implement CTI for individuals and organizations because of the resource constraints such as time, capability, and cost. Hence, different stakeholders (individuals or organizations) can collaborate and create a CTI sharing platform to improve their security stances and other organizations. It is well-known that when connected devices are rapidly intensifying in IoT, the cyber threat to information will also rise. So, to own a reliable, scalable, and high-speed CTI sharing platform, the deployment model should be wisely studied. This research carefully analyzed different forms of CTI sharing deployment models: private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and on-premises. Finally, we suggest the hybrid cloud-based deployment model as a convenient solution for CTI sharing due to its desirable features such as scalability, security, reliability, and high speed.},

This state of affairs is alarming, as we expect hundreds of billion connected devices in a few years, and calls for solutions to help maximizing the usable lifetime of IoT systems. In this paper, we review this problem in detail, and argue that legacy devices using outdated wireless technologies could make use of cross-technology communication to directly interact with newer IoT products, thereby increasing their durability. We also summarize our recent efforts in this domain and highlight how they could help in designing sustainable IoT systems.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, entrepreneurial ecosystem research has grown popular among researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. There have been many research attempts to investigate the gap in the entrepreneurial ecosystem between academics and practice. However, there still a lacks of research that provides an understanding of the interconnectedness and networking among entrepreneurial actors or supporting organisations, particularly in developing countries, for example, Thailand. In order to provide valuable opportunities to enhance and understand start-ups and support organisations networking in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, this paper applied social media analysis to demonstrate how social media data can be used to evaluate networks and explore interconnectedness. The research also helps to understand the relationship between AgriTech, FoodTech start-ups and support organisations in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.Using Twints and the Twitter API, data were retrieved from Twitter's databases for start-ups, incubators or accelerators, and other support organisation information within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The results indicate a lack of interconnections among AgriTech and FoodTech startups and support organisations in Thailand's ecosystem, such as incubators and accelerators. According to an analysis of social media, most start-up aid organisations in Thailand originated from local or national organisations, not global ones. These represent the fragility of Thai start-ups’ support organisations which lack a connection with international opportunities.This research utilised social media analysis as an alternate evaluation approach for assessing the connection or network activity among local entrepreneurial actors. Furthermore, the evaluation findings can be used to identify the weak points in an ecosystem and suggest policies for growing and enhancing a start-up entrepreneurial ecosystem in developing nations such as Thailand.},

The fast evolving mobile market industry resulted in a plethora of low-cost computer systems and pairing electronic components, at very affordable prices. This potential has not been left unexploited by the educational system and thus many relevant activities are developed, commonly under the STEM “umbrella”. The educational curriculum of the engineering institutions is continuously updated worldwide, so as to follow the vast booming of modern digital technologies. In this regard, by following a PBL approach and by making things more appealing via setting targets that match real-world situations, a characteristic automatic control case is highlighted. The whole approach is exploiting arduino-like boards, some additional low-cost components and recycled materials. A step beyond that, programming tools like the app inventor are hired to offer remote interaction functionality, via smart phones, in-line with the modern IoT trends. The proposed case although tailored for university-level students is also suitable for secondary and vocational education, due to its simplicity and its modular and scalable architecture.},

abstract = {Creating smart cities is an increasingly debated aspiration in our society, as these cities, benefiting from advanced technologies, contribute to improving the quality of life for residents. In this context, graph theory proves to be a particularly important tool in the optimization processes of urban infrastructure networks.The main objective of the research is to identify key concepts from graph theory that can be applied in the creation of smart cities with the aim of optimizing urban infrastructure networks. Starting from this objective, the research will focus on defining key concepts from graph theory, such as Kruskal's algorithm for determining a minimum-cost spanning tree and Dijkstra's algorithm, which establishes the minimum-cost path from a starting node to any other node in a graph.Subsequently, the article will include examples illustrating how graph theory can be used to model the urban infrastructure network. Dijkstra's algorithm is applicable to identifying the most efficient transportation routes, reducing congestion and travel time, as well as optimizing pipeline networks and water distribution. On the other hand, Kruskal's algorithm aims to optimize areas of the smart city such as efficient resource management, green space planning, and sustainable connectivity.Therefore, in this article, we will explore the potential that graph theory can have in optimizing the urban infrastructure of a smart city and increasing the efficiency and sustainability of this type of city. The optimal choice of connections and networks can contribute to creating an urban environment that meets the needs of residents in a sustainable and efficient manner.},

Yet pockets of unequal connectivity persist, and technical infrastructures for connectivity remain difficult to design and build even for experts. In this workshop we aim to bring together a global community of multi- and inter-disciplinary researchers and implementers working on infrastructure development and connectivity to explore the existing design challenges and opportunities for bringing technical dimensions of networked infrastructures in conversation with human-computer interaction (HCI) and the social science of infrastructure. We will share, assess and define research problems and resources for rethinking networked infrastructures from human-, community-, and society-centered perspectives, understanding them to be embedded with human values and biases. We particularly intend our collaborative work to support real-world connectivity initiatives, which have grown in critical importance over the pandemic years—especially projects in support of Global South communities. Concrete deliverables from the workshop will include: (1) an initial shared bibliography to help formalize the state of knowledge in our area, (2) an agenda of shared goals, challenges, and intentions in our field, (3) a compilation of resources to support future work, and (4) social and organizing infrastructures for continued communication and academic collaboration.},

abstract = {Those who work in politics and policy are often unprepared to address the issues that current technology developments have created. A glaring example is the congressional hearings with Facebook where Congress Members asked embarrassingly fundamental questions and were not able to get to the heart of the issue. Many congress people do not have technology advisor on staff to assist in addressing technical issues. Not only does Congress not have technology experts on staff, but the few who are involved are not from underrepresented minority communities. This makes it even more difficult to adequately address issues that more directly impact communities of color including predictive policing, voter suppression, and facial recognition.The PhDx fellowship program was created by the Media Democracy Fund to bridge this gap. Underrepresented PhD students in STEM fields spend multiple summers working in various technology policy outlets including Upturn, Free Press, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. In this talk, I will discuss my experience in the program, how it helped me to understand the various career paths I could take in the policy realm with a technical degree, and how I have been able to make a meaningful impact in the field for my community.},

abstract = {In the modern world, digital technologies penetrate into all spheres of society, so to develop and accelerate the processes of digitalization and digital transformation of the domestic economy in the global economic world, to establish appropriate competitive advantages in the digital world economic market, analytical research and scientific and methodological study of such changes is required. The purpose of the research is to study and develop recommendations for the development of digital transformations in the framework of crowdfunding, including as an alternative tool to "traditional" forms of financing.In the course of writing the article, measures to support small businesses in the agro-industrial complex were considered and a conclusion was made about the advantages of using crowdfunding in comparison with other crowdfunding, which, when interacting with fundraising, will have a more significant effect.The study analyzes the resource provision of the agricultural sector of the Leningrad region. The main indicators of financing the implementation of the State program for the development of agriculture in 2013-2020 are presented. Russia and the Leningrad region and based on them the assessment of subprograms under this program was carried out and appropriate recommendations were made.For further confirmation of the above stated, and for the analysis and assessment of the Leningrad Region agricultural sector resource base, we took the Cobb-Douglas production function. Based on the data obtained, it was concluded that a labor-saving type of economic growth is observed in the Leningrad Region, therefore, crowdfunding, along with the use of other alternative financing instruments, will contribute to the expansion of the domestic agricultural industry and a more tangible impact of productive-economic and socio-economic factors.},

abstract = {While climate change has been a longstanding concern of HCI and CSCW communities, this scholarship has rarely drawn attention to the well-documented pattern of minoritized and marginalized communities unfairly carrying the brunt of environmental burdens. Through this one-day remote workshop, we plan to critically extend how CSCW can support climate action by focusing on two social movements, environmental and climate justice, both of which aim to reduce environmental degradation and pursue sustainable communities without doing so at the expense of others. In this workshop, we aim to identify how CSCW and datafication have helped to uphold environmental or climate justice commitments or has been complicit in producing or maintaining environmental harms. We also plan to discuss and identify a CSCW research agenda addressing how to support climate justice principles and processes in designing technologies and systems. We hope that this workshop will help to initiate and foster a longer-term relationship with researchers, activists and practitioners who are engaging with or interested in climate justice in computing.},

abstract = {LoRa (Long Range) is a promising communication technology for enabling the next-generation indoor Internet of Things applications. Very few studies, however, have analyzed its performance indoors. Besides, these indoor studies investigate mostly the RSSI (received signal strength indicator) and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the received packets at the gateway, which, as we show, may not unfold the poor performance of LoRa and its MAC (medium access control) protocol – LoRaWAN – indoors in terms of reliability and energy-efficiency. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN and use its key insights to boost the reliability and energy-efficiency in indoor environments by proposing LoRaIN (LoRa Indoor Network), a new link-layer protocol that can be effectively used for indoor deployments. The approach to boosting the reliability and energy-efficiency in LoRaIN is underpinned by enabling constructive interference with specific timing requirements for different pairs of channel bandwidth and spreading factor and relaying precious acknowledgments to the end-devices with the assistance of several booster nodes. The booster nodes do not need any special capability and can be a subset of the LoRa end-devices. To our knowledge, LoRaIN is the first protocol for boosting reliability and energy-efficiency in indoor LoRa networks. We evaluate its performance in an indoor testbed consisting of one LoRaWAN gateway and 20 LoRaWAN end-devices. Our extensive evaluation shows that when 15% of the end-devices operate as booster nodes, the reliability at the gateway increases from 62% to 95%, and the end-devices are approximately 2.5x energy-efficient.},

abstract = {With the accelerated technological and scientific revolution, the digital economy continues to inject momentum into the high-quality development of China's economy, and has brought great changes to agricultural production. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China (except Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2013 to 2020, this paper adopts the entropy value method and Malmquist index to construct the digital economy development index and the ATFP (agricultural total factor productivity) evaluation index system at the provincial level for measurement respectively. The spatial error model is applied to examine the impact of digital economy on agricultural total factor productivity. The results show that the digital economy not only enhances the agricultural total factor productivity of the province significantly, but also produces a positive spatial spillover effect on the ATFP (agricultural total factor productivity) of neighboring provinces. To sum up, the government should accelerate the digitization of agricultural production facilities, implement differentiated agricultural production measures for different areas, increase the independent innovation capacity of digital agricultural production, and fully release the dividends of the digital economy for the ATFP (agricultural total factor productivity).},

abstract = {Based on five years of ethnographic research and volunteer experience at 45th St Greenspace, in Sunnyside, Queens, this paper argues that technologically-mediated independent or hybrid creative and knowledge workers act as volunteers at a community greenspace because their paid work gives them enough discretionary free time and autonomy in their scheduling to volunteer while still doing other computer-based work at their apartments nearby. Factors in the independent and hybrid work lifestyle, including isolation and an extended amount of time using technology, also motivate individuals to volunteer at the greenspace as it provides a social outlet and time away from technology. Contributing to HCI and CSCW literature that focuses on how technology is used within mission-driven food and agriculture projects, this paper suggests that there is benefit to also understanding how technologies outside of a project impact its direction. I also discuss how emerging work trends give the possibility for increased participation in collective action and greater engagement between urban residents and city space. The dominance of independent and hybrid workers within new collectives, however, impacts these organizations’ culture and governance – with potentially exclusionary consequences.},

My dissertation project attends to these intersecting precarities as a way to reconsider how digital infrastructures can be reworked to address overlapping questions of environmental and digital inequities. My research is situated within marginalized coastal communities in south Louisiana, where legacies of petrochemical extraction has led to deep socioeconomic and ecological disparities, while increased intensity of storms and floods have begun to impede and damage an already sparse network infrastructure. In my project, I use archival, ethnographic, and design research methods to examine longer histories of environmental degradation, investigate current practices of maintaining and developing network infrastructures, and develop approaches for researchers in HCI and related computing fields to re-envision just and equitable network infrastructures.},

abstract = {In the agricultural sector, farmers often face persistent issues such as delayed payments, opaque transaction processes, and over-reliance on intermediaries. This paper presents a blockchain-based paddy crop marketplace aimed at establishing direct trust between farmers and buyers using Ethereum smart contracts. The system employs an escrow-based payment model, where funds are securely locked onchain until the buyer confirms delivery. A mobile-first platform, developed with React Native and supported by a Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database, enables role-specific access for both buyers and farmers. Payment-critical actions are automated and traceable through smart contracts deployed via the Hardhat development framework, ensuring transparency and transactional integrity. The hybrid design leverages blockchain for secure payment handling while maintaining crop listings and general transaction metadata off-chain, secured by backend validations. Although the prototype operates in a simulated Ethereum environment, it demonstrates the feasibility of a localized, mobile-first, wallet-free solution tailored for paddy farmers in Karnataka, India. The system minimises manual intervention, promotes fair and transparent transactions, and lays the groundwork for future scalability, integration with widely used payment systems, and extended dispute resolution mechanisms.},

abstract = {Increasingly, the Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving toward an architecture consisting of sensing and actuation devices communicating with edge computers and storage systems. These "edge deployments" localize communication, computation, and storage for security, increased efficiencies (e.g. lower latency response), and reliability. In settings where electrical power infrastructure is lacking, however, these deployments typically rely on renewable energy and battery storage for power.In this paper, we investigate power-optimizing scheduling for IoT communication in edge deployments that compose battery-powered sensors. We focus on radio communication since it is often the largest component of the sensor battery budget in edge deployments. We model radio communication between sensors and co-located base stations using their distance, bandwidth availability, and duty cycle for data transmission. We present three heuristic approaches that allocate radio bandwidth to minimize sensor power consumption. We consider both shared and decentralized battery infrastructure. We empirically analyze these approaches in terms of performance and computational efficiency and present a methodology for using these techniques to inform configuration and management of energy-efficient edge deployments.},

abstract = {Digitalization of agro-food markets in Russia is currently actively developing areas of the modern economy. The studies were carried out to identify directions and demand for digital technologies of various groups of agricultural producers in Russia, considering their specialization, production size, and holdingization of agricultural production. The paper systematizes factors hindering digitalization of agro-food markets. The motivation for implementing individual elements were determined by the peculiarities of formation and development of the infrastructure in rural areas, profitability of activities of enterprises, their financial health, production scale and specialization, The fact of widespread use of digital technologies which increases the yield of agricultural crops, productivity of farm animals, reduction of cost resources, accompanied by a higher production cost due to high depreciation and maintenance costs of fixed assets, was shown on the example of autonomous agricultural enterprises of the Altai Territory. The authors attributed active use of digital technologies within agricultural holdings to these regional features of digitalization of agro-food market. Directions of digitalization and demand for digital technologies among households, farms and small agricultural enterprises reflect the scientific significance of the study. Practical significance of the study substantiates the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles in carrying out the grain crops care measures (calculation of the costs of growing grain crops was carried out using the normative method) by grain-type agricultural enterprises of the Altai Territory. The quadcopter purchase assumes processing at least 18 thousand hectares per year with a given payback period of 5 years, and processing an average 2,590 hectares of grain crops area extends the payback period up to more than 34.7 years; the use of third-party services is an economically more expedient solution, since the effect from increasing the yield of grain crops and saving resources used in grain production significantly exceeds the cost of contractors' services.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of 3D printers exacerbates existing environmental challenges as these machines increase energy consumption, waste output, and the use of plastics. Material choice for 3D printing is tightly connected to these challenges, and as such researchers and designers are exploring sustainable alternatives. Building on these efforts, this work explores using spent coffee grounds as a sustainable material for prototyping with 3D printing. This material, in addition to being compostable and recyclable, can be easily made and printed at home. We describe the material in detail, including the process of making it from readily available ingredients, its material characteristics and its printing parameters. We then explore how it can support sustainable prototyping practices as well as HCI applications. In reflecting on our design process, we discuss challenges and opportunities for the HCI community to support sustainable prototyping and personal fabrication. We conclude with a set of design considerations for others to weigh when exploring sustainable materials for 3D printing and prototyping.},

abstract = {Application of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing has given many advantages. The measurement of reflectance spectra in plant canopies can be the basis in detecting nitrogen content. Chlorophyll concentrations at different levels resulted in the reflectance spectra measured in the canopy, also being different. This study aimed to develop the method of Nitrogen monitoring using UAV imagery combined with Leaf Chart Color (LCC) to estimate plant nitrogen concentration in rice. To develop the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indices, the Leaf Chart Color was used to measure the greenness of the leaf crop. A high-resolution digital camera modified with NDVI-7 filter mounted to UAV that sensitive to infrared wavelength. The flight altitude was 3, 10, and 15 m. To measure the strength of a linear association between LCC measurements and NDVI estimations, we used a Pearson one-tailed correlation. The Pearson coefficient indicates that the correlation is a strong negative correlation (-0.822) at 3 m altitude, weak correlation (-0.4562) at 10 m altitude, and no correlation at 15 m altitude.},

abstract = {The environment of a pig farm plays a crucial role in the growth of pigs. Suitable breeding environment can ensure the healthy growth of pigs and improve the quality of pigs. More and more attention has been paid to the monitoring and effective control of pig environment. With the rapid development of wireless sensor network technology and mobile communication technology, environmental monitoring system shows a trend of networking and intelligence, which provides a good solution for remote real-time monitoring in various environments. This paper presents a design of remote environmental monitoring system based on LoRa Internet of Things technology, which has the advantages of low power consumption, strong anti-interference ability and long transmission distance. By setting up a variety of sensors in the pig house, the system can monitor the temperature, humidity, gas concentration, dust and other key indicators inside the pig house in real time. Pig farm managers can obtain accurate and comprehensive environmental data and effectively adjust the environmental parameters in the pig house through remote operation.},

abstract = {The rise of rural e-commerce, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has driven agricultural development, resulting in a dual-channel model that combines offline supermarket docking with online e-commerce direct sales. In addition, given the perishable nature of most agricultural products, consumers have shown a preference for high-quality logistics services. By analysing the dynamics of agricultural supply chains in the real world, this paper examines the impact of these logistics differences, starting with the "leading enterprises + farmers" agricultural production model, and focuses on the decision-making problems in the supply chain of agricultural producers represented by leading enterprises. This paper establishes a dual-channel model under centralized decision-making frameworks that incorporates logistics service levels, which contributes to understanding how integrating online channels influences the profitability and operational strategies of the agricultural supply chain, particularly in light of logistics service considerations.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is currently transforming the industrial landscape through the use of innovative technologies and novel data management approaches. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 brought new dimensions of improvement and autonomy into the existing industrial manufacturing processes which has also led to increased expectations for traceability in manufacturing. Traceability enables the tracking of every part and product of the manufacturing process giving insights into each manufactured component and its full history across each operation step that helps manufacturers improve quality and efficiency. Despite the huge potential in facilitating the optimization of the production lines, product traceability has remained a challenging topic in mass manufacturing. Hence, in this paper, an innovative Blockchain-based framework is proposed to integrate the processes of a real production line using the Industry 4.0 Festo Cyber-Physical Factory located at London Digital Twin Research Centre, Middlesex University. Blockchain technology is a distributed and shared database of events for a product life cycle that is encrypted in blocks or smaller data units. This paper introduces a viable blockchain-based framework implemented within a real smart product assembly for internal traceability within the production process in order to improve the security by preventing counterfeiting, identify specific problems on the production line and provide objective proof for product quality assurance.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss how interaction design experiments and interventions can play a role in sensitising humans to the more-than-human—specifically to plants and their significance to our lifeworld. Our work is rooted in two ideas (1) that deepening the understanding of human-plant relations is important for navigating the multiple planetary crises that we are currently facing, and (2) that interaction design allows for exploring the posthuman ontological model that rejects human exceptionalism and regards all entities as entangled and mutually constitutive. In discussing how design on several levels makes possible more-than-human reflections, the paper presents qualitative data gathered from interviews, diary entries, and observations from deploying two of our plant-electronics designs. Through identifying and organising surprises and recurring patterns in how people responded into three types of sensibilities (hermeneutic, existential, and socio-cultural), we discuss what happens when interaction design mediates entanglements between humans, plants, and other more-than-human actors.},

We aim to provide an overview of the field, consolidate existing knowledge, and chart paths for future research. Our analysis of 99 articles identifies six major themes: (1) the role of trust, (2) understanding motivation, risk, and perception of cryptocurrencies, (3) cryptocurrency wallets, (4) engaging users with blockchain, (5) using blockchain for application-specific use cases, and (6) support tools for blockchain. We discuss the focus of the existing research body and juxtapose it to the changing landscape of emerging blockchain technologies to highlight future research avenues for HCI and interaction design. With this review, we identify key aspects where interaction design is critical for the adoption of blockchain systems. Doing so, we provide a starting point for new scholars and designers and help them position future contributions.},

abstract = {The emergence of living organisms as entities in HCI presents an opportunity to collaborate with other beings through technology, align interspecies motives, and nurture greater empathy for the non-human. Plants are particularly interesting because of their natural ability to sense and respond to environmental stimuli and potential to enable more sustainable interaction design. However, due to the cross-disciplinary and emerging nature of this space, there is a need to identify overarching patterns and discern opportunities for unifying future research. This paper aims to systematically analyze existing Human-Plant Interaction (HPI) works by presenting a survey of projects across HCI, art/design, architecture, and bioengineering. We identify core design paradigms along the dimensions of HPI System Architecture, Plant I/O Coupling, Plant Interfacing and Manipulation Techniques, Application Context, and Scale. From these themes, we assemble a framework for HCI practitioners to approach HPI, and discuss opportunities and open questions for future exploration.},
