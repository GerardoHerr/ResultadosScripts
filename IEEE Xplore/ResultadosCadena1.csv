Therefore, it has become necessary to implement strategies to accurately determine water demand at the field level to optimize water use. To achieve this, new digital agriculture techniques based on the use of remote sensing have made it possible to obtain spatially distributed information that, in combination with biomathematical modeling, would allow the spatial and temporal determination of the water consumption of crops. Therefore, this research proposes the development of a Web Platform (Millimetric) capable of processing and interacting with maps based on geospatial information and meteorological data to determine the crop water consumption based on the original formulation of the METRIC model. In a complementary way, Black box and usability tests were carried out on users to validate the usability of the system. The results showed that the platform allowed to obtain information consistent with the literature. However, the errors in the estimates indicated the need to carry out calibrations and validations of the METRIC sub-models associated with the land’s topography, crop type, and meteorology of the place to obtain more precise results.

To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel blockchain-based smart agricultural IoT system framework for regulating the agricultural production environment through trusted data. First, the elliptic curve integrated encryption scheme (ECIES) and the group signature scheme are integrated to guarantee the traceability and identity protection of the data and equipment, respectively. Then, to enhance the security of session key transmission in the ECIES scheme, we further design an on-chain-off-chain key agreement protocol (ECIES-OOKA). In addition, we propose a novel group manager selection method based on probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) for the group signature implementation. Finally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate the group manager selection process and verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The security and performance analysis for the system framework are also presented.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2025.3565593","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62307008); Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology(grant numbers:cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0530); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979808","Blockchain;probabilistic linguistic term sets;group signature;agricultural IoT","Blockchains;Encryption;Cryptography;Agriculture Internet of Things;Security;Protection;Data privacy;Data communication;Elliptic curve cryptography;Privacy","","3","","68","IEEE","29 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, this approach had several disadvantages and limitations: vulnerability, difficult to read, and hostile to the orchid plants. We have developed an orchid database system for the plantation. The system consists of three components. First, we installed the Internet of Things weather station which are used for collecting environmental data such as temperature, humidity and wind data. Second, we developed a hand held tool for tagging using RFID technology and a Raspberry Pi board. We put hundreds of RFID tags on the branches of the trees.

Such applications cross the divide of simple environmental data collectors to highly specific multimedia real-time applications demanding high Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. However delivering QoS guarantees is difficult to achieve when deployed in a hostile environment such as that found in the Precision Agriculture (PA) industry. Difficulties in wireless propagation attenuation delivers an uncertainty to the network design phase. Therefore the motivation of this research is a requirement for real-time characterisation and derivation of suitable propagation models to support network design and deployment planning. In this work, empirical results were collected from a heterogeneous wireless deployment (the real-world ECOMESH test-bed) in a native woodland environment. We derive two empirical models which can be utilised in predicting attenuation network performance in two different scenarios. These models deliver the first phase of a Dynamic Network Management System for maintaining QoS guarantees in heterogeneous wireless networks.","","978-1-5090-3599-1","10.1109/WTS.2017.7943528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943528","Internet of Things;WSN;WMN;Propagation Modelling;Precision Agriculture","Wireless sensor networks;Biological system modeling;Vegetation mapping;Vegetation;Wireless communication;Mathematical model;Agriculture","","17","","18","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most intriguing aspects of 5G technology is the potential to reduce latency for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, especially for latency-sensitive smart farming applications such as fire detection. The data generated by IoT devices such as sensors, cameras, and actuators in intelligent farming applications are growing exponentially. Traditional methods of processing and storing IoT data usually include cloud data centres, which are often far from data sources, resulting in multiple network hops that increase latency. To this end, the existing network infrastructures struggle to cope with increasing traffic and meet the stringent low-latency requirements of various real-time environmental monitoring IoT applications. To solve this problem, Edge Computing (EC) emerged as a solution. Edge technology allows the deployment of 5G Core (5GC) network functions close to the data-generating IoT sensors. This method allows data processing to be performed near the sensor, thereby reducing latency. As a result, this paper proposed an efficient architecture to minimise latency in 5G networks by moving the User Plane Function (UPF) node to the edge of the network closer to users using the Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) strategy. Furthermore, this paper further proposed Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based backhaul. This backhaul was configured to use the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controller, which has been customised with a distributed core to improve throughput, latency, and scalability. Using SDN in the 5G backhaul network allows operators to create dynamic, scalable, and efficient networks capable of serving a diverse variety of services and applications with varying performance needs. The results of the experiment conducted on the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) compliant 5G testbed demonstrated that the proposed architecture reduced the average Round Time Trip (RTT) by 60.7% while improving the throughput by approximately 40.48%. This significant reduction in latency and improvement in throughput paves the way for the implementation of real-world 5G applications, particularly in latency-sensitive sectors like smart agriculture. Agricultural operations will benefit from faster data processing and communication, enabling real-time monitoring, and precision irrigation, ultimately leading to increased efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3466994","Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Tshwane University of Technology (TUT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689585","5G;CUPS;EC;IoT;RTT;SDN","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;Smart agriculture;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;3GPP;Wireless sensor networks","","4","","135","CCBYNCND","24 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to a lack of agricultural infrastructure and understanding, people are frequently unable to produce healthy agricultural goods and are also unable to safeguard their indoor plants from too much and too little sunshine. The IoT-based plantation system described in this research attempts to maximize plant growth while shielding plants from excessive or insufficient sunlight. The system uses sensors to assess important environmental variables such as light intensity, and temperature, integrating IoT technology with agriculture. The gathered data is processed, examined, and sent to a cloud server for archival and examination. Real-time data visualization, notifications, and user interaction are made possible through a user-friendly mobile application. The main focus is on protecting plants by keeping an eye on light levels to prevent harmful consequences of excessive or insufficient sunshine exposure.

The start point of precision agriculture is the collection of agricultural growth data, but it is not an easy job as the APB (Agricultural Production Base) is always far away from city center and located remotely. As a result, the APB is hard to be covered by network, and an online data collection method takes no effects. Besides, acquisition work may last for a long time in field, so the terminal must be long duration without direct power supply. Aiming at these requests, this paper presents a PMDAT (Portable Multifunction Data Acquisition Terminal) based on ARM, which supports not only online data collection, but also supports offline data collection. When network is not available, PMDAT launches an embedded application to support working offline and stores the offline collected data in terminal temporary, when network is available, PMDAT first uploads the offline collected data automatically and updates itself to maintain consistent basic information of APB with Data Center, then launches an embedded browser to support collecting data online. In addition, in order to support working in field for long time, we integrate a powerful rechargeable battery into PMDAT, and pay attention to low power consumption design. This is a new approach to meet practical needs very well.","","978-0-7695-5088-6","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832129","working offline;data acquisition terminal;pollution-free agriculture products;long duration;auto updating","Agriculture;Databases;Servers;Data collection;Data acquisition;Hardware;Computer architecture","","1","","6","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the reliance on wireless communication in UAV networks poses security challenges that can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive agricultural data. This paper proposes a novel approach to address these concerns through the incorporation of blockchain technology for secure communication in UAV networks deployed for smart agriculture. The proposed system leverages the decentralized and tamper-resistant nature of blockchain to establish a trust-based communication framework. Each UAV node in the network is equipped with a blockchain-enabled communication protocol, ensuring that data exchanges are securely recorded in an immutable ledger. This not only enhances data integrity but also mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation. To facilitate secure communication, smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce predefined rules governing data transactions within the UAV network. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized entities can access and modify agricultural data, fostering a transparent and accountable ecosystem. Additionally, cryptographic techniques such as public-key encryption enhance the confidentiality of transmitted data, safeguarding sensitive information from eavesdropping and unauthorized interception. The proposed blockchain-enabled secure communication system is further enhanced by incorporating consensus mechanisms that validate and confirm the integrity of data across the network.

It has been heavily deployed in applications such as traffic management, air traffic control, disaster and agricultural monitoring. In such operations, high volumes of sensitive and private data is collected and transmitted to the ground stations. The usage of unreliable and open wireless channels during the message exchange process exposes the IoD to a myriad of security threats. Therefore, numerous authentication protocols have been developed in the recent past to mitigate these threats. However, most of these protocols are still inadequate in the provision of robust security against typical IoD attacks. Because, they involve resource-intensive operations and make them unsuitable for an IoD environment. Therefore, we put forward a new authentication protocol which exhibits cost-effective performance. To develop the new protocol for secure IoD communication, we leverage on biometrics, physically unclonable function and elliptic curve cryptography for the robust performance. Extensive formal security analysis using the random oracle model (ROM) is showing that proposed protocol is provably secure. The informal security analysis is also performed which demonstrates its robustness against all the threat assumptions in the Canetti-Krawczyk (C-K) model. Specifically, it is found to offer conditional privacy, unlinkability, anonymity, mutual authentication, session key establishment and perfect key secrecy. Moreover, it is capable enough to mitigate numerous threats such as forgery, impersonation, stolen verifier, replay, physical capture, de-synchronization, known secret key and smart card loss attacks. The performance is cost-effective as evident from the comparative analysis showing that the proposed protocol incurs the lowest energy consumptions and computation overheads at relatively low communication costs compared to many other authentication schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3576313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11022697","Authentication;elliptic curve cryptography (ECC);Internet of Drones (IoD);physically unclonable function (PUF);security","Authentication;Drones;Protocols;Security;Privacy;Elliptic curve cryptography;Physical unclonable function;Protection;Internet of Things;Elliptic curves","","","","51","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The information system prepared of course needs to have a good code architecture so as to produce a well-performed system. To ensure this, one approach is by identifying the code smell. This study will try to test and compare the code on a mobile-based agricultural information system before and after the code smell-based code refactor is carried out. The code smell of the program will be identified, gets refactored, then its code smell and performance will be re-tested. The result obtained is code smell-based code refactor increases the application's performance.

This is also true for the livestock domain, in which the technologies developed to sustainably raise animals production are submitted to experiments while preserving their health and wellness. However, since such institutions often conduct several parallel innovation projects, the establishment of an infrastructure to support those experiments can be costly, repetitive, and error-prone. For that purpose, we developed E-SECO, a software ecosystem that encapsulates a lifecycle model for scientific experiments and its supporting platform and actors. The main contribution of this paper is presenting how the E-SECO architecture was successfully applied to create a livestock architecture (named e-Livestock architecture) from which two different (and independent) scientific experiments involving real systems were deployed and executed in the livestock domain. The first experiment involved a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place; whilst the second experiment involved an automated monitoring environment for aviaries. Preliminary results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract concepts of scientific experiments for livestock domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of an architecture to support engineering real systems for different livestock sub-domains, and (iii) support the experiments towards a future transfer of technology to industry.CCS CONCEPTS • Applied computing → Agriculture; • Software and its engineering → Software architectures.","","978-1-4503-9334-8","","EMI; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808601","Compost barn;livestock;aviary;software ecosystem;experiments;dairy cattle","Technological innovation;Production systems;Dairy products;Software architecture;Ecosystems;Technology transfer;Computer architecture","","1","","34","","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a tool is aimed at analyzing the factors that influence the growth of the crops, and determine a predictive model of soil moisture. Within a greenhouse, the variables that affect crop growth are: relative humidity, soil moisture, ambient temperature, and levels of illumination and CO2. These parameters are essential for photosynthesis, i.e. during processes where plants acquire the most nutrients, and therefore, if performing a good control on these parameters, plants might grow healthier and produce better fruits. The process of analysis of such factors in a data mining context requires designing an analysis system and establishing an objective variable to be predicted by the system. In this case, in order to optimize water resource expenditure, soil moisture has been chosen as the target variable. The proposed analysis system is developed in a user interface implemented in Java and NetBeans IDE 8.2, and consists mainly of two stages. One of them is the classification through algorithm C4.5 (chosen for the first trial), which uses a decision tree based on the data entropy, and allows to visualize the results graphically. The second main stage is the prediction, in which, from the classification results obtained in the previous stage, the target variable is predicted from information of a new set of data. In other words, the interface builds a predictive model to determine the behavior of soil moisture.","","978-1-5386-3894-1","10.1109/ETCM.2017.8247519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247519","Precision agriculture;Big Data;data mining;KDD;data analytics","Air pollution;Agriculture;Tools;Green products;Data mining;Prediction algorithms;Soil moisture","","7","","17","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ICT has changed many aspects of human lifestyle, work places and living spaces. However, there is one sector namely agriculture which has been deprived of the real advantages of ICT. Hence, there exists a digital divide between farming industry and other industries.

To reduce the global warming effect, farming industry needs to be integrated with relevant technologies.

An approach combining spectral library with expert system classification methods by spatial data mining techniques is present. Being one of spatial data mining techniques, inductive learning algorithm is used to discover knowledge of spectral library for the expert system and is designed specially for monitoring featured crops of South China. So the intelligent expert classifier can make use of spectral data, attribute data and spatial data of spectral library to extract information of South China's featured crops. The study pre-defined some attributes of inductive learning algorithm which are in favor of featured crops mapping, for improving the efficiency of algorithm and ensuring the usability of rules. The estimation of lychee planting area of Shenzhen city in 2005 was presented as a case study. The following classification rules of lychee were acquired by running inductive learning algorithm: for example, 0.062< reflectance of TM2 <0.071, 0.47<NDVI<0.54, 20<DEM<90, special rules of lychee planting in Guangdong province, 40<area of lychee orchard (pixel number) <5000 and the result of classification was presented by figure 2. Compared with traditional unsupervised classification, it improves classification accuracy greatly, and the rate of accuracy reaches 93.5% with KAPPA coefficient of 0.85.

The next generation of automotive embedded software is rapidly migrating to the AUTOSAR standard, which is an architectural composition of software components idealized to establish an open industry standard for the automotive industry. AUTOSAR aims to increase the reuse of these software components, in particular between different vehicle platforms, and between OEMs and suppliers. Inside this development process, software control suppliers are able to check if the system functionalities are attending to the requirements already in preliminary phases, even if the ECU is not yet available.

Typical application scenarios include smart-homes, smart-cities, precision agriculture, and intelligent transportation. On the software side, novel paradigms are emerging to dominate the complexity introduced by the CPS with a large number of spatially distributed devices. Among them, aggregate computing is gaining traction, for it enables expressing the behavior of aggregates of devices by considering their ensemble as a single computational entity, allowing expressive space-time computations. In this paper, we introduce a software architecture which allows aggregate programming software to execute on a network of LoRa-communicating devices.

These in turn create issues in environmental sustainability, issues with the responsible use of resources, and reduce waste production, which brings about the need to address the future challenge of IoTs by developing processes and policies to reduce carbon emission and further optimize IoT greenhouse effect. Greening of IoTs is the solution to these issues which focuses on manufacturing energy-efficient IoT hardware as well as green software development. IoT plays a vital role in the automatization of vertical farming methods. The smart and intelligent capability of IoTs facilitates better and faster yield of agricultural produce. The extensive use of IoTs in this sector also plays a major role in increasing greenhouse emissions and carbon footprint.
