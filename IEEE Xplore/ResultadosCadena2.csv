Existing systems mostly construct wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and incorporate a gateway to bridge the networks with the Internet for remote monitoring. Some work uses sensor nodes, cloud storage and/or IoT platform to create IoT-based monitoring systems. In contrast, the crop monitoring and automation system in this paper uses an IoT cloud-based platform and open APIs to utilize many services available via the Internet. Specifically, low-cost sensor nodes form a cluster-based WSN to save energy consumption and communicate with each other through the platform. Sensed data are shown through a web application for both real-time and historical data displays. If node's power is low, a Line application message is sent to alert the user to replace batteries. A weather API is also used to obtain a weather forecast to reduce water usage. Furthermore, the Google Maps API is used to display node's location, facilitating network maintenance. The evaluation clearly shows that the system can provide real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity and control water valves. Connecting many services or technologies via the Internet thus leads to highly effective utilization of the IoT in smart farming with affordable cost.","1882-5621","978-1-5386-5757-7","10.1109/WPMC.2018.8713163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8713163","Internet of Things;IoT-based Framework;Monitoring and Automation;Precision Agriculture;Smart Farming;Wireless Sensor Networks","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;Temperature sensors","","6","","17","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In today’s agricultural landscape, where farmers are faced with unreliable weather and soil conditions, traditional methods are often ineffective for successful crops and farms, therefore, crop selection becomes inefficient, leading to lower yields and waste of inputs. This paper presents Cropsight, an IoT-based crop recommendation machine learning system. The system uses sensors to measure soil nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK), and measures pH, temperature, humidity, and moisture. These values are evaluated using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to predict the best crops for the present growing conditions. Using a web-based dashboard with React.js, it provides a means to monitor the soil parameters and crop recommendations in real time. With this methodology, Cropsight optimizes farm input outputs, enables data-driven decision making, and helps generate higher yields and sustain more sustainable farming practices.","2996-5357","979-8-3315-5503-0","10.1109/ICESC65114.2025.11212456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11212456","IoT(Internet of Things);Machine Learning;Precision Agriculture;Crop Recommendation;Smart Dashboard","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Smart agriculture;Soil measurements;Humidity measurement;Crops;Machine learning;Soil;Nearest neighbor methods;Sensors","","","","10","IEEE","30 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This web application helps farmers better understand the requirement of water content in the soil which will eventually help in better irrigation followed by better crop production. The web application comprises three display sections, each displaying temperature, moisture & humidity values, and a manual button has been included for scenarios when there is an abundance of water due to rainfall. In such cases, alerts will be generated and the farmer can dig a way for excess water removal. The temperature sensor values are further processed for filtering out the noise by performing the Kalman Filter technique using Processing IDE application by Arduino.

The proposed system controls the necessary conditions for the plant to grow hydroponically, and cultivators can remotely control agriculture using IoT. Various sensors are deployed in the field to collect parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH and water content. The sensor data that has been collected and the external input data such as the District Name, Crop Name, Area in acres and the Type of Hydroponics system is then sent to microcontroller, which in turn processes the data and then acts on it. The data that has been collected is sent to the cloud, processed and the notifications are delivered to the farmers. The proposed web application provides the farmers with an estimate of how much crop yield will be produced based on the given sensor and user input. The crop yield prediction is provided in tones and is estimated using Random Forest algorithm.","","979-8-3503-3401-2","10.1109/I2CT57861.2023.10126337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10126337","Agriculture;Hydroponics;Organic farming;sensors;Random Forest Algorithm","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Microcontrollers;Plants (biology);Crops;Hydroponics;Prediction algorithms","","9","","15","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This information is then used to monitor crop development, detect pests and diseases, and assess the efficacy of pest management strategies. The collected information is exploited by the Decision Support Systems (DSS) at the core of IPM. The DSS assists in saving resources and minimizing the overall cost while improving overall pest management efficiency. It also provides an intelligent decision support mechanism for pest management methods, such as which pesticides to apply and when to use them.

We analyze the significant limitations of traditional, manual approaches to planning agrotechnical operations, which are often characterized by low accuracy, high labor intensity, and subjective decision-making. These drawbacks lead to suboptimal resource utilization, increased crop loss risks, and reduced profitability for agricultural enterprises. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive digital system architecture designed to automate, enhance accuracy, and improve the resilience of agricultural production. Our methodology includes a detailed ""AS-IS"" analysis of current business processes, identifying critical bottlenecks such as fragmented information and the absence of analytical tools. Subsequently, we present a ""TO-BE"" model, outlining a target intelligent information system. This system integrates key functional modules for automated data collection via IoT sensors, real-time weather integration through APIs, and advanced data analysis using machine learning algorithms for tasks like yield prediction, optimal sowing time estimation, and soil condition diagnostics. The architecture also features a user-friendly interface accessible via web and mobile applications, offering real-time monitoring, AI-generated recommendations, and automated reporting with integrated financial analytics. A comparative analysis vividly demonstrates that this digital transformation shifts agricultural management from a reactive, labor-intensive, and error-prone model to a proactive, data-driven, and predictable one. Implementing such intelligent technologies promises to significantly improve the efficiency, precision, and sustainability of agricultural management, ultimately bolstering food security and regional economic development.","2836-614X","979-8-3315-6708-8","10.1109/RusAutoCon65989.2025.11177381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11177381","agricultural planning;BPMN;business process optimization;IoT;machine learning;agronomic information systems;smart agriculture","Accuracy;Automation;Digital transformation;Decision making;Production;Soil;Real-time systems;Planning;Information systems;Business","","","","30","IEEE","30 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The communication between ESP32 and Raspberry Pi is established with REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface), a way to connect applications and components in microservices architectures. A highly robust PostgreSQL-based database is used to store the data in Raspberry Pi, which allows the collection of farm data locally without having to connect to any web storage.

It allows farmers to have real-time advice so that they can secure their decisions. the system can offer farmers a classification of the most suitable crops for a given field to allow the farmers to choose the seeds adapted to the soil for a better yield. Moreover, the application gives farmers who practice irrigated agriculture the possibility to rationally control the management of their water resources by irrigating at the right time when the soil and the crops demand it. The implementation and case studies for validation show that the application facilitates the daily hard work of the farmers in southern Senegal and helps to improve their yield, which is an innovation in the sector of agriculture in Senegal.","","978-953-290-128-3","10.23919/SpliTech58164.2023.10193191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193191","Internet of Things;smart agriculture;smart farming;automatic irrigation;real prototype","Smart agriculture;Natural resources;Technological innovation;Correlation;Prototypes;Soil;Real-time systems;Climate change","","2","","26","","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Just relying on naked eyes to detect diseases is very difficult. We propose the development of a cost-effective and affordable smart farming prototype that can detect plant diseases in advance and notify farmers so that remedial actions could be taken. Also, a web-based system has been developed to allow the farmers to monitor the status of their plants in the greenhouse. The development of such a smart farming plant disease detection system will allow farmers to have the ability to detect diseases at an early stage of the plants which will minimize yield loss from full-blown disease outbreak in their greenhouse. One important feature of this system is its ability to categorise the Septoria plant disease for which categorizing the stages of the disease outbreak on the leaf is very important. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that machine learning classification algorithm can be used in raspberry pi without losing performance. Based on our tests we also find that random forest classifier with colour histogram is the best combination to be run by this prototype for efficient plant disease detection.","","978-1-83953-002-9","10.1049/cp.2018.1545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726970","Internet of things;Machine Learning;Plant Disease;Agriculture;Greenhouse","","","5","","","","3 Jun 2019","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The paper discusses the introduction of blockchain technology in ensuring transparency in the smart agriculture supply chain. We introduce a decentralized model whereby cold storage hubs are placed at every 10-km interval so as to preserve perishable goods. These hubs are linked to a blockchain-enabled web application (DApp) that allows the stakeholders, i.e. farmers, transporters, distributors, and consumers, to track real-time recording and movement of agricultural products without depending on centralized mediators. In contrast to traditional web applications, this decentralized application (DApp) can interact with the blockchain ledger directly to ensure that all records, transactions, and movements of products are secured, immutable, and transparent. Data recording on the blockchain platform will include crop production, storage conditions, transportation timelines, and delivery details in order to ensure trust and accountability across the supply chain. Smart contracts automate critical operations such as product registration, payment release, and quality confirmation, eliminating the chance of manual errors and fraudulent acts. Transparency provided by this blockchain platform helps to reduce inefficiencies and risks of spoilage, thus ensuring food safety. By integrating blockchain with cold storage infrastructures, this project will provide novel solutions to the problems associated with postharvest handling of perishable agricultural commodities through maintaining their quality, freshness, and traceability. Moreover, the decentralized structure of the DApp provides a platform for fair and direct trade, enhancing market access, thus reducing losses for farmers. This model could transform agricultural supply chains, especially for the benefit of small and medium farmers, by providing them a set of tools to facilitate transparent, secure, and automated supply chain management.","","979-8-3315-1247-7","10.1109/ICISC65841.2025.11188359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11188359","Blockchain & Smart Contracts;IoT (Internet of Things);Supply Chain Transparency;Cold Storage Monitoring;Automated Transactions;Decentralized Ledger Traceability","Smart agriculture;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Production;Decentralized applications;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Recording;Stakeholders;Internet of Things","","","","19","IEEE","13 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to meet this demand and the exponential growth of the population, farmers need water to irrigate their property. Farmers require a fix that modifies their business practices because of the scarcity of using this resource. To keep up with and satisfy Demand, Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality thanks to new technologies. Automated Irrigation: Smart irrigation systems can automatically adjust schedules based on real-time data, such as weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and evapotranspiration rates. This helps farmers apply water more efficiently, reducing water waste and improving crop health. By collecting and analysing agricultural information through a combination of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, decisions have become increasingly precise to make decision-making easier. A cost-effective, intelligent, and adaptable irrigation strategy that can be used in a variety of settings is presented in this paper. For smart agriculture, machine learning algorithms are the foundation for this strategy. MongoDB and the Node-RED platform were used. We created an acquisition map from a collection of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and rain) in a setting that guaranteed improved plant development for months. Based on our data, we used many different models: SVM, Simple Bayes, KNN, and Regression using logit. The outcomes showed that K-Nearest Neighbours outperformed other models (LR, SVM, NB) with a 98.6% identification rate and a 0.12 root mean square error (RMSE).

It utilises cutting-edge technologies to maximise field-level management. Precision agriculture has completely transformed crop production by leveraging the latest developments to maximize field-level management. Predicting crop yields with accuracy helps farmers reduce their environmental impact, increase productivity, and make well-informed decisions. Accurate and timely insights are frequently lacking in traditional agricultural yield prediction approaches. The study offers a deep learning method for precisely predicting agricultural yields. Accurate crop yield forecasts assist farmers in minimizing their negative environmental effects, boosting productivity, and making educated choices. However, there are many obstacles because conventional agricultural yield prediction methods frequently need more timely and precise insights. Despite their success, several challenges still exist. These include handling heterogeneous data, dealing with missing values, and the complexity of capturing non-linear relationships in the data. To determine whether decision trees or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) are ideal in crop yield prediction, these models are compared with each other. Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) are prominent among these techniques. Even though the MLP model was more accurate, decision trees also are relevant to the prediction process. This means have the capability of understanding multi-layer intra-data intricacies through their structure whereas decision trees may overfit on noisy data or grow too deep hence leading to many splits also known as being bushy unless they are pruned to reduce this bushiness. The study suggests a novel method for predicting agricultural productivity using a Machine learning model Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

In order to solve the issue of an explicit watering system determined by air temperature rate and soil moisture, farmers still need a technological innovation of smart agriculture that can be managed remotely by the help of the modern internet. This is addressed by adding attributes such as humidity, light intensity and moisture content level. The proposed novel system uses an Arduino UNO, a soil moisture sensor, ESP8266 chip and sensor of type DHT11. Additionally, a Web Application was integrated into the system’s design for remote control. It is used to see the sensor’s readings and water the plants automatically.

There is a gap between current food productivity growth and needed growth. To boost the yield, farmers switched to extensive use of chemical fertilizers. Excessive fertilizer usage has its negative impact like decreased yield, wastage of fertilizer, damage to soil, and groundwater contamination. Currently, farmers mostly rely on guesswork, estimation, experience when deciding the crop that should grow, and the fertilizer that should be used.

Farmers find it challenging to predict crops that will grow well in their fields because of the changing climate, which results in low yields, a reduction in food sources, and negative effects on their livelihoods. Several variables, including soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH content, weather humidity, and rainfall, need to be considered, to predict the best crops to plant using computational tools. In order to do so, we used crop, soil, and weather datasets along with six machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost). We implemented the XGBoost algorithm in a web application using Flask, which has the highest accuracy of 99.31%.

To ensure the pipeline is protected from corrosion, an operator needs to inspect and maintain the CP system regularly by following the NACE standard. Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) is responsible for waterworks in large areas and possesses a long metal pipeline, which is about 1,562 kilometers long. The number of the test stations for inspection of the CP system is about 5,912 stations. Normally, the operators inspect the CP level manually in the fields, consuming more time and cost of operations. Additionally, the on-site work can be dangerous for the staff. The aim of this paper is to remotely monitor the CP values by applying the LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN is the key IoT technology in the wide area network applications such as smart cities, smart farms, surveillance, landslides, water quality, and so on. The advantages of LoRaWAN technology are low power consumption, long-range transmission, and low cost. In this paper, a LoRa-based sensor node was designed to measure the CP values. The results showed that the sensor node has an error of less than 1% compared with a digital multimeter. Besides, the sensor nodes were deployed in the fields to experiment on not only the CP values but also the signal quality of the LoRa modulation.

The system which has been designed to operate remotely consists of the temperature/humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor interfaced to the ATMEGA 2560 Microcontroller, a local display and the CC3000 Wi-Fi shield also interfaced to it. When the system is active, the sensors sense these physical parameters and then, the LCD displays the current conditions sensed locally. Furthermore, a connection is established between the CC3000 Wi-Fi shield and the access point in order to transmit the sensed parameters to the web application via the web address for remote monitoring and data acquisition. The entire system is capable of sensing parameters, display them locally and transmit the same parameters to the web where they can be remotely monitored, acquired and analyzed.

These devices must be capable of operating over long distances, operate with low energy requirements, and resist climatic adversities and external factors such as dust and water to function effectively in rural areas. In this work, we introduce a low-cost autonomous IP67 IoT vision device designed and implemented in a real-world scenario. The device is used for automatic detection of wheat characteristics in order to optimise human resources when monitoring the growth and health of crops. Equipped with algorithms capable of capturing and processing images, the device has been designed to be computationally efficient, cost effective and power efficient. The device utilises the LoRaWAN communication protocol and requires 2.878 W and has 3.5 months of autonomy. Furthermore, it leverages specific low computational algorithms that can operate with low-resolution images making them more effective. To test the device in a real-world scenario, an algorithm that measures the height of wheat was introduced using classical vision techniques, with 97 % accuracy. Furthermore, the device incorporates an ad-hoc trained YOLOv8 and YOLOV10 object detection machine learning algorithm for the detection of spikes and stubble areas, which achieves a recall of 71.1 % and a precision of 79.5 % for the YOLOv8. In the case of the YOLOv10, it achieves a recall of 70 % and a precision of 77 %. The results are validated by expert agronomists annotations and data collected via a custom created web platform for remote visualisation and decision making tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3453993","Junta de Andalucía through the Projects oliVAr and IRRIGATE-PY20 RE 017 LOYOLA(grant numbers:GOPO-SE-23-0001); Agencia Andaluza de Cooperación Internacional Para el Desarrollo (AACID) through the Project Reactivando(grant numbers:0INN005/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666684","Computer vision;object detection;smart agriculture;YOLOv8;YOLOv10;spiking;stubble;wheat;height;IoT","Crops;Robots;Monitoring;Robot kinematics;Cameras;Accuracy;YOLO;Computer vision;Smart agriculture","","4","","61","CCBY","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The revolution in robotics and automation also introduces the concept of robotic farming that has the benefits to grow and inspect the food items more effectively. The need of the time is to introduce robustness and automation in the agriculture industry of Pakistan. Therefore, a Self-Sustained Farming System (SFS) is designed that has the capability to flourish a small agricultural area without any intervention of the farmer. The SFS is also effective in such terrains where conventional farming is difficult. The design of the SFS makes it capable to perform multiple tasks, such as weeding, seed injection, and soil moisture measurement. Moreover, the SFS changes the daily watering pattern for different plants with respect to the weather conditions of the area. Furthermore, the cloud interface of the SFS provides the feature of continuous updated remote assessment of the SFS system parameters. The SFS has another advantage to work both in grid-connected and off-grid (solar powered) mode. A detailed cost analysis of real-time data of SFS is conducted with respect to the saving of water and energy resources. The scope of the SFS is not limited to small kitchen gardens, the SFS is scalable to big garden and vegetation farms.","2409-2983","978-1-7281-0279-5","10.1109/CEET1.2019.8711852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711852","Electronic circuits;feedback;agriculture;automation;solar energy;web design","Sustainable development;Solar energy;Agriculture;Electronic circuits;Feedback","","1","","14","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
