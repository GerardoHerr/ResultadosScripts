"From Digital Twins to Digital Twin Prototypes: Concepts, Formalization, and Applications","A. Barbie; W. Hasselbring","Software Engineering Group, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany",IEEE Access,"31 May 2024","2024","12","","75337","75365","The transformation to Industry 4.0 also transforms the processes of developing intelligent manufacturing production systems. Digital twins may be employed to advance the development of these new (embedded) software systems. However, there is no consensual definition of what a digital twin is. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of the digital twin concept and formalize the digital twin concept using the Object-Z notation. This formalization includes the concepts of physical twins, digital models, digital templates, digital threads, digital shadows, digital twins, and digital twin prototypes. The relationships between all these concepts are visualized as class diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language. Our digital twin prototype approach supports engineers in the development and automated testing of complex embedded software systems. This approach enables engineers to test embedded software systems in a virtual context without the need of a connection to a physical object. In continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, such digital twin prototypes can be used for automated integration testing and, thus, allow for an agile verification and validation process. In this paper, we demonstrate and report on the application and implementation of a digital twin using the example of two real-world field studies (ocean observation systems and smart farming). For independent replication and extension of our approach by other researchers, we provide a laboratory study published open source on GitHub.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406510","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Open Access Publikationskosten; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10540125","Cyber-physical systems;embedded software systems;digital twin prototypes;automated testing;continuous integration","Digital twins;Unified modeling language;Embedded software;Testing;NASA;Mathematical models;Industrial Internet of Things;Cyber-physical systems;Testing;Automatic testing","","24","","68","CCBY","28 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process lends particular strength to building quality software by means of the ongoing clarification of existing requirements and the discovery of previously missing or unknown requirements. Traditionally, the iterative reexamination of a systems requirements has not been the panacea that practitioners sought, due to the predisposition for requirements creep and the difficulty in managing it. The paper proposes the combination of evolutionary prototyping and an aggressive risk mitigation strategy. Together, these techniques support successful requirements discovery and clarification, and they guard against the negative effects of requirements creep. We embody these techniques in a comprehensive software development model, which we call the EPRAM (Evolutionary Prototyping with Risk Analysis and Mitigation) model. The model was intentionally designed to comply with the Level 2 Key Process Area of the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model. Validation is currently underway on several software development efforts that employ the model to support the rapid development of electronic commerce applications.","","0-7695-1125-2","10.1109/ISRE.2001.948548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948548","","Creep;Capability maturity model;Software prototyping;Prototypes;Programming;Software quality;Risk analysis;Software engineering;Electronic commerce;Application software","","7","","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effective usability evaluation method and analysis technique on usability data always help to achieve high usability. A numerical measurement in usability evaluation can facilitate the comparison between different designs of product prototype. In this paper, we propose a simulation approach based on FSM to abstract the user interface rules according to the activities of real user, and present a fuzzy algorithm for measuring usability data on simulated FSM. In practice, we take a healthcare terminal PDA case into experiment, and illustrate how the approach is applied on the comparison between two different prototype-design-candidates of the PDA and resulted in two groups of data from the perspective of usability.","","978-0-7695-3605-7","10.1109/CSO.2009.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5193672","fuzzy analysis;usability data;healthcare;PDA","Usability;Medical services;Personal digital assistants;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Prototypes;User interfaces;Software measurement;Computer science;Educational institutions","","","","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contribution of stakeholders contributing in software requirements have a place with distinctive domains, because of which ambiguities, inconsistencies might arise moreover giving rise to incorrectness. Many tools are available for software requirements verification and validation but the issue of stakeholders belonging to different domains is still under consideration. As these requirements are not understood properly, it causes schedule delay and greater cost in the last stages of software. Requirements verification and validation are the most vital activities in requirement engineering that guarantees software quality and has an extraordinary impact on software cost and its success. The requirements verification and validation are an affirmation that the product requirements record is free of unwanted requirements and totally reliable. Keeping in mind the end goal of removing conflict, recognizing failures and making the product requirements document completely useful is the key component. So these requirements should be appropriately confirmed and accepted by the clients before conveying to the development team. Thus, ontology might be picked as an answer for checking and approving the requirements among stakeholders of distinctive domains. In this study improving requirement verification and validation process through ontology. We have used expert reviews and case study to evaluate the developed ontology that indicates different concepts, properties and constraints in the process of requirement verification and validation. With the help of the developed ontology, it is shown that its use for requirement verification and validation shows improvement in consistency, applicability and other factors.","","978-1-4799-1954-3","10.1109/APWCCSE.2014.7053837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053837","Verification and Validation (V&V);Ontology;Requirements and Process Improvement","Ontologies;Software;Business;Animation;Schedules;Semantics;Prototypes","","6","","26","IEEE","5 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recent studies on active vision have shown some potential for agricultural tasks, each model has been designed and validated on a unique environment that would not easily be replicated for benchmarking novel methods being developed later. In this paper, we introduce a dataset, so-called DAVIS-Ag, for promoting more extensive research on Domain-inspired Active VISion in Agriculture. To be specific, we leveraged our open-source ""AgML"" framework and 3D plant simulator of ""Helios"" to produce 502K RGB images from 30K densely sampled spatial locations in 632 synthetic orchards. Moreover, plant environments of strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes are considered at two different scales (i.e., Single-Plant and Multi-Plant). Useful labels are also provided for each image, including (1) bounding boxes and (2) instance segmentation masks for all identifiable fruits, and also (3) pointers to other images of the viewpoints that are reachable by an execution of action so as to simulate active viewpoint selections at each time step. Using DAVIS-Ag, we visualize motivating examples where fruit visibility can dramatically change depending on the pose of the camera view primarily due to occlusions by other components, such as leaves. Furthermore, we present several baseline models with experiment results for benchmarking in the task of target visibility maximization. Transferability to real strawberry environments is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using the dataset for prototyping real-world solutions.
